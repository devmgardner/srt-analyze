1
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,862
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,699
Come here!

3
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,454
- Yeah!
- Right here!

4
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,206
Toss me a bird, Bumpy!

5
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,749
Bumpy!

6
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,044
- Yeah!
- Bumpy! We love you!

7
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,712
There you go, darling.

8
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,133
Over here! Over here!

9
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,555
Frank! Come on!

10
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,223
Come here.

11
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:36,198
This is the problem.
This is what's wrong with America.

12
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,536
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.

13
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:45,416
The grocery store
on the corner is now a supermarket.

14
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,878
The candy store is a McDonald's.

15
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,924
And this place, a
super-fucking discount store.

16
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,219
Where's the pride
of ownership, huh?

17
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,431
Where's the personal service?

18
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,232
You see what I mean?
Shit.

19
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,739
I mean, what right do they have,
of cutting out the suppliers,

20
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,284
pushing out all the middlemen,

21
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,413
buying direct from
the manufacturer?

22
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,168
Sony this, Toshiba that.

23
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,255
All them Chinks putting
Americans out of work.

24
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,389
That's the way it is now.

25
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,478
You all right?

26
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,397
You can't find the
heart of anything

27
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,026
to stick the knife.

28
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,738
Hey!

29
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,115
Anybody here?

30
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,742
Can I help you?

31
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,202
Call an ambulance.

32
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,037
Forget it, Frank.

33
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,832
There's no one in charge.

34
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,464
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,093
Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,

36
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,554
according to the eulogies, a giving man,
a man of the people.

37
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,348
No one chose to use
in their remembrances

38
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,560
the word most often associated with
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson, "Gangster,"

39
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:32,273
whose passing has brought a who's who
of mourners on this chilly afternoon.

40
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:36,610
Lucchese mob boss Dominic Cattano,
Harlem crime figure Nicky Barnes.

41
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,778
Nicky! Nicky!

42
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,029
From the political arena,

43
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,532
the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,

44
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,995
and Chief of Police and Commissioner,
sports and entertainment luminaries.

45
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,290
Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,

46
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,918
was a folk hero among Harlem
locals for over four decades.

47
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,379
Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,

48
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,381
by others as a ruthless criminal...

49
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,216
I don't understand, you know.

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,554
I would've thought that Bumpy would
put out a better spread, you know?

51
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,514
You want something?
No, thanks.

52
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,266
I want chicken wings
at my funeral.

53
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,893
- All right, Nicky Barnes.
- Who is that?

54
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,729
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?

55
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,172
I just kept popping him
in the face 'cause that's what I do.

56
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,901
Mmm.

57
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,656
I don't have a lighter.
You have a light?

58
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,077
Oh.

59
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,835
Okay?

60
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,920
That's very good.

61
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,756
Hey, Frank.

62
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,844
Go get me a light
while you're at it.

63
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,889
Appreciate it.

64
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,099
Don Cattano.

65
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,268
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?

66
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,686
Good.

67
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,937
Would you like a drink, sir?

68
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,815
Give him a scotch on the rocks.

69
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,989
Come on. Come on.

70
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,459
I know you're hurting, Frank.

71
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,252
So am I.

72
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:18,921
I'm all right.

73
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,548
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.

74
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,359
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say anything
to you, but he made me promise

75
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,637
that if anything ever
happened to him,

76
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,973
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.

77
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,893
I appreciate that.

78
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,231
You know, half the people in this room
owed Bumpy money when he died.

79
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,484
They think I'm gonna forget to collect,
but I'm gonna get that money.

80
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,654
Well, that's the spirit.
Go get 'em.

81
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,950
Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

82
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,619
Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,

83
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,873
give us US v. Mead, subject,
issues, what the determination was

84
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,501
and what it means to us today.

85
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:02,464
Class, you'll be critiquing
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

86
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,885
I hate hearing
my name called, you know?

87
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,930
It means I gotta get up in front
of the class, I gotta turn around,

88
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:14,143
and I know every one of those people
there, they know more than I do.

89
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:18,230
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying, it's public speaking.

90
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,731
I get physically ill,
I wanna throw up.

91
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,650
And that's what you
wanna do for a living.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,902
No, I don't wanna be like
that, man, I wanna beat it.

93
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,070
So, should I do this?

94
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,614
No, he'll take it from me, he knows me.
I've known him since high school.

95
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,117
From high school?
Good morning. Yeah.

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,401
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.
It's good service.

97
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,913
Throw it in? All right.
Yeah.

98
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,791
What's up, Susie?
Hey, Jay.

99
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,835
How you doing, baby?
All right.

100
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,295
All right. Ready?

101
00:07:58,854 --> 00:07:59,980
Hey! That's his head!

102
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,575
You're supposed
to be my friend, asshole!

103
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,828
I swear to God, Richie,
I didn't know it was you.

104
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,290
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

105
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,500
You bit my fucking hand.

106
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,343
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?

107
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,420
We're on loan to County.
County?

108
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,624
- How's that working out for you?
- Hey, fuck you.

109
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,801
Hey, I'm sorry. Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?

110
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,804
Assault on a police officer?
I don't think so.

111
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,683
Hey, for old times' sake. What can we do?
What do you want? What can I give you?

112
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,061
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

113
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,021
- Five years minimum.
- Five years.

114
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,275
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want? Who do you want?

115
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,860
Who do you got?

116
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:51,615
You want Big Al's bookie? You want
his accountant? I'll give him to you.

117
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,209
Stop, stop, stop.

118
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,461
There he is.

119
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,132
That's him.
That's the bookie.

120
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,968
All right, Carlo, get lost.

121
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,678
Right here?
Yeah, right here. Get out of the car.

122
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,598
- This is... I'd rather not.
- Come on. Let's go.

123
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,475
Take it ease.

124
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,080
Want to stay
with him or the car?

125
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,666
Let's see who comes for the car.

126
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,890
Think he made us?

127
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
You called in the warrants, right?
So, where are they?

128
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,395
I just called, man.

129
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,357
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.

130
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,653
I saw him with the slips, Jay.

131
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,449
You saw policy slips? You saw grocery
bags. You don't know what's in 'em.

132
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,951
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.

133
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,038
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour, the warrant will be here.

134
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,916
I got night school, all right?
Guess you're gonna miss it.

135
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,343
Fuck this. Come on.
You sure?

136
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,428
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

137
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,816
Fuck.

138
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,944
Jay.
Yeah?

139
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,618
Fuck.

140
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,250
WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!

141
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,669
It's the groovy sound of the
Jefferson Kaye Saturday Night Show.

142
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,963
Dig, honey,
it's coming up time for news.

143
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,716
Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ.

144
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,176
Stick around, the Jace-man's got 10.
Back in 10.

145
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,394
It's not just a couple
of bucks, all right?

146
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,146
It's the same thing in principle.

147
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh, are we talking principles?

148
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,277
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money, says one thing.

149
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,864
He turns in cops who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.

150
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,407
Yeah, well, then we're
fucked both ways.

151
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,285
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then you're right, we're fucked.

152
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,328
But not if we keep it.

153
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,582
God damn it, man!
Did we ask for this?

154
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,668
Did we put a gun to someone's head
and say, "Give us your money"?

155
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,547
Cops kill cops they can't trust.

156
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,178
We can't turn it in, man.

157
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,314
Can you believe that?

158
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,908
How much is it?

159
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,869
$987,000.

160
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,457
Well, what happened
to the rest of it?

161
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,212
What the hell are you doing
counting it out here in front of everybody?

162
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,755
Are you nuts?

163
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,885
Get it back in the bags, seal them up
and down into the property room.

164
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,355
You fucking Boy Scout.

165
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,590
What? What?

166
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,575
Detective Trupo, sign here.

167
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,539
You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?

168
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,999
- Always.
- Hell, yeah.

169
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,208
Fucking A.

170
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,879
Oh, look at this.

171
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,130
There you go.

172
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,633
- All right, look at this.
- Fucking beautiful.

173
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,594
There's three more boats.

174
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,312
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

175
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,731
- I know.
- All right, be careful.

176
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,194
Hey! Just enough for
the reagent test.

177
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,781
A little less.

178
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,748
This is the
French Connection dope.

179
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:19,169
Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan
and Sonny Grosso took from us.

180
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,546
The cops seize it,
arrest everyone,

181
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,049
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,

182
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:27,636
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.

183
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,138
They basically control
the market with it.

184
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,807
Mr. Rossi,
I have a surprise for you.

185
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,936
They've been doing it for
years now. They live off it, our dope.

186
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,020
What do you think?

187
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,022
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

188
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,441
Those fucking crooks.

189
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,652
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.

190
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,365
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.

191
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,536
You walk down the street, nobody bothers
you 'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

192
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,163
Half a key.

193
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,415
How is your day now?

194
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,085
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for hisself.

195
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,714
Motherfucker!

196
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,179
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.

197
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,390
That would never
happen with Italians.

198
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,227
More important than any
one man's life, is order.

199
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,611
Frank.

200
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,240
Hey. Come on in, Claude. Sit down.

201
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,288
How y'all doing, huh?
Good.

202
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,832
So, you see Nate over there? Yeah?

203
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,208
Yeah, all the time.

204
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,377
Nate is everywhere. He's good.
Yeah.

205
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,701
He's still over there?
Yeah. He's got himself a club now.

206
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,298
- Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
- Bangkok.

207
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,427
Bangkok?
I don't think he's ever coming home.

208
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,807
Come on.

209
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,045
On the house,
for our boys in uniform.

210
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,131
Thank you, sugar. That's very kind.

211
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,008
Thank Frank.

212
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,634
Thanks, Frank.

213
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,637
Just relax.

214
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,767
You have to boot this
shit a couple of times.

215
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,812
The cops keep cutting it,
selling the shit.

216
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,026
I don't want to say anything,
'cause the price is right,

217
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,321
but that shit in Nam is way,

218
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:56,159
way heavy.

219
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,103
Did you ain't seen the jar, Frank?

220
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,064
I think you walked right past it.

221
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,110
The money jar, Frank. What do I
gotta do, put a fucking sign on it?

222
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,319
Hmm?

223
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,658
Look at this nigger right here.
You know, Frank,

224
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,993
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

225
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,954
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in Harlem right now.

226
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,873
I'm the landlord and
the lease is 20%.

227
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,711
Look, don't sell dope then, Frank.
Get a real job.

228
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,965
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?

229
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,424
Well, you can come work for me.

230
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,511
Okay? You can drive me around, huh?
You can open my doors.

231
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:01,558
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir", "Right away,
sir", "Anything you want, Massa Johnson".

232
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,562
Twenty percent.

233
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,196
Twenty percent is my profit, Tango.

234
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,521
If I give you that, then what do
I got left? Nothing, man.

235
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,054
Twenty percent puts
me out of business,

236
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,204
and every somebody
you know out of business.

237
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,374
There's legitimate ways of doing things,
Tango, and then there's this way.

238
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,668
Not even Bumpy took 20%.

239
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,753
Bumpy's fucking dead.

240
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,466
My man.

241
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,260
Twenty percent?

242
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,270
Twenty percent.

243
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,597
Doc, let's go.

244
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,167
Out. Good job. Sit.

245
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,672
A leader, like a shepherd,

246
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,842
he sends his fastest nimble sheep,
out front.

247
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,761
And the others will follow.

248
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,306
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.

249
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,559
Here, boy! Here we go. Right here.
Bring it here. Yeah.

250
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,731
Now he's got the stick,
and the cane, he'll use it!

251
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,192
If he has to.

252
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,653
But most times he doesn't have to.

253
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,531
He moves the whole herd quietly.

254
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:47,830
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?

255
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,583
The middleman.
Buying direct.

256
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,254
Putting Americans out of work.

257
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,216
That's the way it is now, Frank.

258
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,595
That's the way it is.

259
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,074
The drug problem
in Vietnam is more than marijuana.

260
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:27,745
At this point, it is estimated that one
third of American troops are experimenting

261
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,706
with opium and heroin.

262
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,368
The authorities say
they have confiscated

263
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,878
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills.

264
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,090
Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates

265
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,426
is subject to a thorough shakedown.

266
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,207
Soldiers have access to the
drugs at many rest and relaxation spots

267
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:49,378
in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas
throughout Vietnam and Thailand.

268
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:53,632
Officials say the easy availability,
relatively cheap cost

269
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:57,386
and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon and the Far East,

270
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:01,473
is leading to an epidemic of heroin
addiction among US soldiers.

271
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,229
- Operator.
- Yeah, international.

272
00:22:07,313 --> 00:22:09,565
What city?
Bangkok.

273
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,484
You know the country code?
Yeah, 376.

274
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:17,156
For the first three minutes, it'll be...
I got it, I got it. I got it.

275
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,870
Hello?

276
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,580
Soul Brothers.
Hey, can I help you?

277
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:25,873
Nate.

278
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,167
Do I know you?
Yeah, it's me.

279
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,919
Who?
Me, Frank. Your cousin, negro.

280
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:36,884
Go on, get yourself a new suit.

281
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,130
Look, I'm sorry.

282
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:16,632
Oh, please, Richie.

283
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:20,803
It couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, all right?

284
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,471
We're moving.

285
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:24,556
What? Where?

286
00:23:26,016 --> 00:23:28,435
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

287
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:32,398
To my sister's.

288
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,817
Your sister's? In Vegas?
Yeah.

289
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,403
You are not moving to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.

290
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:41,907
What am I supposed to do with him,
leave him with you? There's a picture.

291
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:45,077
Hey, guys!
Be cool.

292
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,125
Laurie, Las Vegas is not
the kind of place that you raise a kid.

293
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,420
Like this is a good environment?
And around your friends?

294
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,380
When am I supposed
to see my boy?

295
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:58,674
This weekend.
Last weekend.

296
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,677
God damn it.

297
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,430
Hey! I asked you nice
to shut up, right?

298
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:05,753
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

299
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:09,017
I swear I will pull out my gun and
put a bullet in your fucking heads!

300
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:11,145
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!

301
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,564
Calm down, man.
Okay, be cool.

302
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:17,776
Fucking crazy, man.

303
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:21,029
You don't have a gun.

304
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:25,033
You sure?

305
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,960
You are crazy, Richie.

306
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:41,425
You don't have room for us.

307
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:44,970
I'll see you in court.

308
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:48,265
Come on, Michael.

309
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,392
Say bye to your dad.

310
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:53,729
Get over here.
Hey, kiddo.

311
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:58,609
I'll see you next week, all right?
We'll do something.

312
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:01,528
Let's get you an ice cream.

313
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:30,182
You have 10 minutes remaining.
Ten minutes.

314
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:39,418
Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

315
00:26:43,714 --> 00:26:46,550
Oh, come on, girl. Don't tell me $5
don't get me a little something.

316
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:49,428
Can you dig that it
costs money to be here?

317
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:51,263
Oh, come on, girl.

318
00:27:24,796 --> 00:27:26,882
How much you want, Frank?

319
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,635
Tell him I want 100 keys.

320
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,514
Frank, ain't nobody I know can get
you that much personally, all right?

321
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,475
You're gonna have to piece it
together from several sources,

322
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,101
and it's not gonna be 100% pure.

323
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:40,020
I don't want that.

324
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,189
I know what you don't want, Frank,

325
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:47,027
but look, what you're gonna need is to get
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate, all right?

326
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,571
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna deal with you at all.

327
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,990
I understand that, but by
then it's gonna be too late.

328
00:27:52,074 --> 00:27:54,701
It'll be already chopped up. I wanna
go get it where they go get it from.

329
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:55,869
I wanna go to the source.

330
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:59,122
So, you're gonna go get it yourself?
Why not?

331
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:01,583
Huh? I came this far.

332
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:03,752
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?

333
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,212
I'm in the jungle. Look around.

334
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,130
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.

335
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:08,924
Nigga, I'm talking about
snakes, all right?

336
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,801
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,

337
00:28:10,884 --> 00:28:14,596
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.

338
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:16,890
You wanna go into the jungle?

339
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,642
We're going.

340
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:21,937
Fuck it. Let's go.
We're going.

341
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,063
Why not? Let's go.

342
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:07,858
Hey, Frank.

343
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,528
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,

344
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:15,824
General Chiang Kai-shek's
defeated army.

345
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,656
How would you get it
into the States?

346
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,575
You ain't got to worry about that.

347
00:29:58,658 --> 00:29:59,826
Who do you work for in there?

348
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,496
You ain't got to worry
about that, either.

349
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,456
Who are you, really?

350
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:07,167
Frank Lucas, says it right
there in my passport.

351
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,960
I mean, who you represent?

352
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:10,128
Me.

353
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:16,051
You think you're going to take
100 kilos of heroin into the US,

354
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:20,180
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going to allow that?

355
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:21,306
That's right.

356
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,694
After this first purchase, if you are
not killed by Marseille importers,

357
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:40,075
or their people in the
States, then what?

358
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:43,829
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.

359
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:45,192
And if it's all the same to you,

360
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:48,625
I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here
no more.

361
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,335
Of course not.

362
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,297
My man.

363
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:57,050
Soul brother, huh?
Soul brother.

364
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:44,306
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover them and
the pilot and the boys on the other end.

365
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:46,641
Give them a hundred.

366
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:49,144
Fifty is gonna cover it, Frank.

367
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:51,980
Give them a hundred,
give them the whole thing. Here.

368
00:31:52,063 --> 00:31:53,356
And look,

369
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:58,653
that's all I got. So, if that dope
don't arrive for any reason...

370
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,994
Hey, listen, cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

371
00:32:06,077 --> 00:32:09,372
I ain't got no time
to be going to nobody's funeral.

372
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,459
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

373
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,752
My man.

374
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,059
Fuck.

375
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:38,610
Richie?
Yeah.

376
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:39,903
This fucking guy made me.

377
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:42,447
I don't know how he did,
but he did.

378
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,823
He went for his gun.

379
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,617
I had to do it, man.

380
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,660
There's 100 people
out there that heard the shots.

381
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:49,871
You gotta help me.
You gotta do something.

382
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:51,706
Baby.

383
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:52,874
Where are you, Jay?

384
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:55,919
That's the problem.

385
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:02,676
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.
I got a 10-13.

386
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,761
Copy that. What's your 20?

387
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:06,554
Tower two.

388
00:33:08,223 --> 00:33:09,891
Apartment 1G.

389
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,352
Kent and West in the projects.

390
00:33:12,435 --> 00:33:13,853
Identify yourself, please.

391
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:15,313
Detective Richie Roberts.

392
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:18,316
That's a negative.
I got no units in that area.

393
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,776
Bullshit.

394
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:22,570
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.

395
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,781
Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area.

396
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:26,574
Fuck you.
That's a negative.

397
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:38,962
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?

398
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:40,213
You know what I'm saying?

399
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:42,215
I'll get the motherfucker!
Kick his ass!

400
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:45,093
Yo, cracker,
you gonna pay for this shit!

401
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:52,100
Where the fuck you going?
Where the fuck you going?

402
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,812
What you gonna do, motherfucker?

403
00:33:55,937 --> 00:34:00,025
Hey, hey, be cool.
Be cool, all right?

404
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:02,819
I'll find out what's
going on in here.

405
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:12,662
Richie.

406
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:19,210
Open the door!

407
00:34:19,294 --> 00:34:21,004
Open the motherfucking door!

408
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,297
Where's your backup?

409
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,757
You motherfucking cracker!

410
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,384
You got no backup?
Why is that?

411
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:28,678
You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!

412
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,056
Bandage his neck.

413
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,265
Richie, he's dead.

414
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,850
I know he's fucking dead, right.

415
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,727
Bandage his neck,
clean up his head,

416
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,188
prop him up on the gurney so he's
sitting and open his fucking eyes.

417
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,356
Open this fucking door!

418
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:40,732
All right? Let's go.

419
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:42,317
Fuck.

420
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,489
All right, clean him up.

421
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,949
Okay.
Where's the solution?

422
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:53,453
Hey.
Huh?

423
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:57,248
God damn it,
open this fucking door!

424
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,626
Give me your gun.
What?

425
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,044
Give me your gun.

426
00:35:01,169 --> 00:35:03,922
Get your punk
ass out here, man!

427
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:06,508
You have your badge?
Yeah.

428
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,093
I'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch!

429
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:09,636
You guys ready?
Uh-huh.

430
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,013
Okay.
Just keep moving forward.

431
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,391
You all right?
Yeah.

432
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,644
It's okay! It's okay!

433
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,771
We're taking him to
the hospital.

434
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:22,690
Everybody, step back!
Step back!

435
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:25,151
He's all right.

436
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:27,237
He's okay.
We're taking care of him.

437
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,155
Step back.
Step back.

438
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:33,410
Everything's fine.
Just stand back.

439
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,286
He's all right.

440
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,704
He's alive.

441
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:38,957
What happened inside?

442
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,792
We're taking him to the hospital.

443
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,469
Thanks, man.

444
00:35:52,387 --> 00:35:53,763
Fuck.

445
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:57,183
That asshole pulled a piece on me, man.
Can you fucking believe it?

446
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,810
He pulls a piece on a cop?

447
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:01,604
I had to do it, man.
Kill or be killed.

448
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:04,566
Fucking crazy world, right?

449
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:09,028
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?

450
00:36:09,112 --> 00:36:12,657
Investigating stuff, man, you know,

451
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,035
just like you taught me.
Checking on guys,

452
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,622
following things up,
putting the pieces together.

453
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:23,418
That guy was a dealer.
A fucking dealer. Scum of the earth.

454
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:27,338
That guy didn't pull
a gun on a cop, Jay.

455
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:31,509
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie,
a junkie who was trying to rob him.

456
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:33,595
What the fuck you say?

457
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:36,723
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?

458
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:39,350
What the fuck is that?
That's my fucking money, man!

459
00:36:39,434 --> 00:36:41,060
I earned this shit. That's mine!

460
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,854
I earned it doing good cop work!
What the fuck is this?

461
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,689
What the fuck is that?
I earned it doing good cop work!

462
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,357
You murdered a guy!
I earned it getting shot at!

463
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:48,193
You murdered a guy!

464
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,197
You murdered him, you robbed his money,
then you called me to get you out of it.

465
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,199
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.

466
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:58,286
I'll tell you the facts, man. Just write
the report the way I say it happened,

467
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:02,457
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.

468
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,001
I can't do that.

469
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:09,756
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

470
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,550
No one will work with me after that.

471
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:16,804
I can get off this shit, Richie.
That's easy.

472
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:21,976
Just write the report between us,
as partners.

473
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:25,188
I can't do that.

474
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:28,358
Hey!

475
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,070
Stop! Stop!

476
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:33,863
Fuck it.

477
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:13,611
Open the trunk.

478
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:31,754
Peace now! Peace now! Peace now!

479
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,049
LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?

480
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:39,012
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!

481
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:42,015
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!

482
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:45,393
as loud as we can
that the Vietnam War should stop,

483
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:48,730
and that the best way
to stop it is for the United States

484
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:51,858
to simply pack up
and get out of Vietnam right now.

485
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:58,990
How we looking?

486
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:05,622
Typically, what I see
is 25% to 45% pure.

487
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:09,417
I mean, there's no adulterants,
no alkaloids, no dilutants.

488
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,252
It's 100%.

489
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:17,467
May I?

490
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,177
Take it with you.

491
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,054
Thank you, Frank.

492
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,716
I'll take it. No contingencies,
no loans, no nothing.

493
00:41:23,092 --> 00:41:24,302
Cash.

494
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,721
Fabulous.

495
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,772
I'm not talking about your proclivities,
Richie. Those I only know too well.

496
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:37,940
I'm talking about being a cop.

497
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:40,568
You're talking
about taking money?

498
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:41,903
I don't do that.
It's not my thing.

499
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:43,488
What about your friends
from the neighborhood?

500
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:45,782
Do you still hang out with them?
Yeah.

501
00:41:45,865 --> 00:41:47,158
Play baseball on the weekends.

502
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,702
Wise guys?
That's gonna look good.

503
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,538
Guys I went to high school with.
So what?

504
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:54,624
What about Joseph Sodano?

505
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,001
What about him?

506
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,837
Richie, I'm just trying to understand
things your wife has said.

507
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:01,255
If they're not true, tell me.

508
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:02,924
Yeah, he's one of them.

509
00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:05,510
Is he also your son's godfather?
Yeah.

510
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:07,553
He's definitely fucking her.

511
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:12,016
Do you really care about this?
Or do you just not want her to win ever?

512
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:19,357
You know, there's an interview room
on the second floor.

513
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,651
That's what I thought.
The door only locks from the inside.

514
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:23,194
All rise.

515
00:42:29,575 --> 00:42:33,621
Oh, God, Richie. Richie, fuck
me like a cop, not a lawyer!

516
00:42:43,047 --> 00:42:44,715
Don't answer it!

517
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:51,681
Yeah?

518
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:07,780
Richie Roberts.
Hey, Norm?

519
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:11,534
Hey. Richie Roberts.

520
00:43:11,617 --> 00:43:12,702
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.

521
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:15,162
Hey, Norm. How are you?
Good.

522
00:43:15,246 --> 00:43:17,290
So, is that him?
Yeah.

523
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:29,218
Picked a nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

524
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:30,928
It's been like this.

525
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:35,474
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.
It's like nothing we've seen before.

526
00:43:40,229 --> 00:43:42,189
Something I gotta sign?

527
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,191
Yeah.
It's right here.

528
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:46,777
I'm taking this with me. I'll register
it with Essex County, all right?

529
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,321
All right.

530
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:56,203
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

531
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,540
In order to fight and
defeat this enemy,

532
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:04,462
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive.

533
00:44:04,795 --> 00:44:07,506
Federal authorities
have announced their intention

534
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,092
to establish special
narcotics bureaus

535
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:12,970
in Washington, New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago...

536
00:44:13,054 --> 00:44:15,806
A detective without
the support of his fellow detectives

537
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,725
really can't do much.

538
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:21,687
You know why I don't have it.

539
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:25,274
Doesn't matter.
You did what you had to do.

540
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,403
Greatest city in the world!
And it's turning into an open sewer.

541
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,782
Everybody's stealing, dealing.

542
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,578
Look at you.
You can't work because you did your job.

543
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:41,082
Good news is, you're not the
only honest cop in town.

544
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:45,920
The special narcotics bureau
in Washington is not a dog and pony show.

545
00:44:46,003 --> 00:44:49,423
They are sincere. I know this
because they want us to orchestrate it.

546
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,051
And I want you to
head up things here on our end.

547
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,053
If it's federal, who do I
answer to, the post office?

548
00:44:54,136 --> 00:44:55,513
No, you answer to me,

549
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:58,140
me and the US Attorney,
nobody else.

550
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:02,186
You never step foot
in a police station again.

551
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:05,314
You work out of your own place,
you pick your own guys,

552
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:09,110
guys that you know
would not take a nickel off the sidewalk.

553
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,067
Well, we got the lovely transit.

554
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:41,072
600-year-old mahogany doors.

555
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,911
Now, look at that.
Can't you just feel it?

556
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,664
I think it's lovely.

557
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,916
Watch your step.

558
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,506
Look at these beautiful floors.

559
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,594
At least, I don't know, 200 years old.
And it's hard to get the cracks...

560
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:06,765
Now this was one of my favorite rooms but
we had some problems with the plumbing.

561
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,768
I even fixed it. I know it works.
It's not gonna leak.

562
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:15,940
Here it is.

563
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,116
You know, I used to be a really good
piano player when I was a kid,

564
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,036
but then, I don't
know why I forgot.

565
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,622
Life goes on. Well...

566
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,044
How long are you gonna be?

567
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,298
Oh, and do me a favor, please.
Mind the doors.

568
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:44,135
Those are beautiful, ornate
glass doors, you know.

569
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:52,811
Here we go, Jimmy. Come on.

570
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,979
Oh, yeah. Give it back.

571
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,218
Huey's.

572
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:02,553
Huey. What up, boy?

573
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:03,804
Yeah, who this?

574
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,431
Who you think it is, boy?

575
00:47:05,514 --> 00:47:07,224
Frank.
Frank who?

576
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,227
Frank your brother, negro.
Frank?

577
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:14,106
That's right.

578
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:16,192
Hey, Melvin!
Melvin, where's Ma?

579
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:18,903
What?
Frank's on the phone!

580
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:20,488
Hey, Ma!
How are you doing, Frankie?

581
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,573
Frank's on the phone!

582
00:47:23,032 --> 00:47:25,076
Say what?
Mama, Frank's on the phone!

583
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:26,911
Frank? Oh, my Lord!

584
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:29,205
Yeah, when?
Well, you just say it, man, yeah.

585
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,665
Listen, I'm gonna
call y'all back

586
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:33,042
at 6:00. I want you to get
everybody together, all right?

587
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,210
Get Mama, get everybody.

588
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:36,045
All right?
Okay.

589
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,229
Hey, Frank!

590
00:47:53,312 --> 00:47:54,605
What's happening, Frank?

591
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:57,274
Hey, Frankie.
How you doing, Uncle Frank?

592
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,277
Get out the car.
Get the kids, get the kids.

593
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:02,738
Look at this, baby.

594
00:48:02,822 --> 00:48:06,867
Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.

595
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:11,664
Oh, I'm telling you, this is
some piece of land you got here!

596
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:14,333
I wonder what
the poor people are doing here?

597
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:15,835
And whose
house is that, Frankie?

598
00:48:15,918 --> 00:48:18,087
That is your house, Mama.

599
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,881
Mine?
That's yours.

600
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:23,342
And who else?

601
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:28,514
Now, there, that's my room
right there, man. Right over there.

602
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:37,356
Anybody want some
more collard greens?

603
00:48:39,108 --> 00:48:43,529
I wanna tell you how happy
I am to see all my children at the table

604
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,115
and the grandchildren
at the same time.

605
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:47,950
My heart's so happy.

606
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:49,577
Enjoy yourselves.
Right on, Grandma.

607
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:52,621
I hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating over here.

608
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:56,542
That boy right there, he got a arm on him.
I mean, a major league arm.

609
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,710
Oh, yeah?

610
00:48:57,793 --> 00:48:59,211
Ain't that right?

611
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:00,463
Right on, Pop.

612
00:49:00,546 --> 00:49:03,049
Well, we'll see after dinner. We'll
see him throw it around a little bit.

613
00:49:03,132 --> 00:49:04,884
No, no, you can't catch him, man.

614
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,385
I'm talking about...
I'm talking about...

615
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:08,179
This guy throw harder than Gibson.

616
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:10,556
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

617
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:12,892
Can you catch him?
He gonna...

618
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:14,560
He gonna catch the ground.

619
00:49:14,643 --> 00:49:17,354
We might've played catch, I think,
when I was about five years old.

620
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:20,316
Since then,
he ain't been able to keep up.

621
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:25,321
This is your room.
It's perfect.

622
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,240
Oh. Why, it's...

623
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,618
Will you look at this?

624
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:31,786
Oh!

625
00:49:32,995 --> 00:49:36,165
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's just...

626
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:37,792
I...

627
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,841
How did you...

628
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:47,426
I had it made.

629
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:50,513
From memory.

630
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,181
You were five when they
took it away on me.

631
00:49:52,264 --> 00:49:54,058
That's right.
How could you remember it?

632
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,768
How could I forget, Mama?

633
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:04,026
I'll just tell you it is perfect.

634
00:50:04,527 --> 00:50:06,779
It's all perfect.

635
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:14,453
I can't tell you how
much I love you.

636
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:16,330
I love you, too, Mama.

637
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,207
It's okay.

638
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,803
Both these guys, good
with wires, they got solid informants,

639
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,806
and they're honest and
they're fearless.

640
00:50:33,889 --> 00:50:36,475
They're insane, Richie, like you.

641
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:38,519
Where are they?

642
00:50:40,688 --> 00:50:44,233
That's Jones with the
skinny white broad.

643
00:50:44,316 --> 00:50:45,985
Best I ever seen on the street.

644
00:50:46,068 --> 00:50:49,655
He knows dope,
but he's together, all right?

645
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:52,158
He's a stand-up guy all round.

646
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:55,744
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.

647
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:59,331
He loves a big ass, man.

648
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:04,044
He's a bulldog. He don't fuck around,
all right. He's got a bit of a temper,

649
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,756
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your grandmother.

650
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:12,261
Listen, Richie. We work together.
You want me, you gotta take them, too.

651
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:25,608
When do we start?

652
00:51:28,944 --> 00:51:30,154
The man I worked for,

653
00:51:30,237 --> 00:51:31,906
he had one of the biggest companies
in New York City.

654
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:34,408
He ran it for more than 50 years.

655
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:38,704
Fifteen years,
eight months and nine days,

656
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:40,467
I was with him every day.
I worked for him,

657
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:44,293
I protected him, I looked after
him, I learned from him.

658
00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:47,379
Bumpy was rich, but he
wasn't white man rich, you see?

659
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:48,964
He wasn't wealthy.

660
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:51,425
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did, but he didn't,

661
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:53,135
he just managed it.

662
00:51:53,219 --> 00:51:55,638
The white man owned it,
so they owned him.

663
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:57,139
Nobody owns me, though.
Hey.

664
00:51:57,223 --> 00:51:59,183
How you doing, babe?
Good.

665
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:01,936
That's 'cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

666
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:04,688
that's better than the competition,

667
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:08,317
at a price that's lower
than the competition.

668
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,861
Well, what are we
selling here, Frank?

669
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:28,379
How you doing, Red?

670
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:30,256
These are my brothers,
just got here from North Carolina.

671
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:31,423
Everybody, this is Redtop.

672
00:52:31,507 --> 00:52:32,925
Hello.
How you doing?

673
00:52:33,008 --> 00:52:35,427
- And the ladies.
- Hey.

674
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:38,764
What wrong? Y'all niggas
ain't never seen hoochie before?

675
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:40,214
Why are they all naked?

676
00:52:40,266 --> 00:52:42,017
So they can't steal nothing.

677
00:52:42,518 --> 00:52:43,602
Right.

678
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,275
The most important thing in business
is honesty, integrity, hard work,

679
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:51,694
family,

680
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:54,613
never forgetting
where we came from.

681
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:56,573
Thank you, Charlene.

682
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:06,500
See, you are what you are in this
world, that's either one of two things.

683
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,296
Either you're somebody,

684
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,507
or you're nobody.
Be right back.

685
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,900
I need these fresh. 'Cause if I
have to come back here and get you,

686
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:32,985
- you know what it is.
- Tango.

687
00:53:33,068 --> 00:53:34,653
- Don't y'all play that.
- Yes, sir, I hear you.

688
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:36,655
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.

689
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:38,407
What about you, Frank?
You need anything?

690
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,617
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.

691
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:42,341
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.

692
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,121
Here's a jar right here.
Twenty percent.

693
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:46,498
You got the jar?
That's right.

694
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,251
Get the fuck out of here...
What you gonna do?

695
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:53,088
What the fuck you gonna do, Frank?
Huh? What you doing?

696
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:57,551
You gonna shoot me in front of everybody?
Huh? Come on.

697
00:53:59,928 --> 00:54:01,263
Shit.

698
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:15,944
There you go. Twenty percent.

699
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:41,723
So, what was I saying?

700
00:54:50,982 --> 00:54:52,066
Jones.

701
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:55,570
Jonesy.

702
00:54:57,488 --> 00:54:58,990
That was nice, man.

703
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:03,661
Just doing my melodious thing, baby.
Got you.

704
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,421
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.

705
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:18,301
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

706
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:22,472
We're looking for
the suppliers and the distributors.

707
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:25,725
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.

708
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,561
No powder under 40 kilograms.

709
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,604
Any less than that, then somebody
else can waste their time.

710
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:33,441
We gonna be handling the big shipments,
the big money and the big temptation.

711
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:34,805
I heard a story about you.

712
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,654
That you found a million dollars
in unmarked cash

713
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:40,574
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?

714
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:44,244
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a problem with that?

715
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:50,458
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.

716
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,503
I should be down in South Florida with a
68-foot cruiser doing fishing charters.

717
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:54,671
You and me, both.

718
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:58,008
But you know,
I didn't, so here I am,

719
00:55:58,091 --> 00:56:00,594
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.

720
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,873
- All right?
- Bingo.

721
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:55,523
See that, Richie?
Yeah.

722
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:58,568
And this stuff is
your everyday stuff.

723
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,529
But this Blue Magic,
twice the potency.

724
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:06,284
I mean, it's the purest thing I ever seen in the streets.
It's strong enough to smoke.

725
00:57:06,368 --> 00:57:09,412
And that's for those white suburban kids
who are scared of needles.

726
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:11,331
I paid 10 bucks for that.

727
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:14,084
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every corner out there.

728
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,919
So, how is that possible?

729
00:57:16,002 --> 00:57:19,714
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good for half as much?

730
00:57:27,597 --> 00:57:29,975
Hey, man. Frankie,
baby, good to see you!

731
00:57:30,058 --> 00:57:31,059
Everything's good?

732
00:57:31,142 --> 00:57:32,269
Yeah, man, just got
back from Europe,

733
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:34,938
over there for two months,
south of France, man.

734
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,694
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.

735
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,031
Nicky!

736
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:47,742
Give us a smile, Nicky.

737
00:57:47,826 --> 00:57:49,147
Show us the cover.

738
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,360
You know what I'm saying, man?

739
00:57:50,412 --> 00:57:51,746
Hey, Nicky, over here.

740
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,290
There you go.

741
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:56,876
Nicky!

742
00:57:58,295 --> 00:58:01,131
Who is that?
Look at you, my man.

743
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:10,932
All right.

744
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:12,559
Ladies and gentlemen,

745
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:15,312
the Brown Bomber! The champ!

746
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:17,063
Mr. Joe Louis!

747
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:27,991
Who's that with Joe?

748
00:58:28,074 --> 00:58:29,993
Miss Puerto Rico.

749
00:58:30,076 --> 00:58:32,996
Puerto Rico? Is she a beauty queen?
Mmm-hmm.

750
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:35,206
For real. The beauty queen.

751
00:58:59,439 --> 00:59:02,275
Welcome.
My main man. My main man.

752
00:59:07,364 --> 00:59:08,865
Can you all excuse us
for a minute, please?

753
00:59:08,948 --> 00:59:10,033
Yeah, sure, Frank.

754
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:11,826
Yes, sir.

755
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:14,329
Thank you.

756
00:59:18,124 --> 00:59:19,542
What's going on, man?

757
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:21,336
What you smiling about?
I don't know.

758
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:24,089
What is this? Huh?
What's what?

759
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:26,299
What's what?
Come here.

760
00:59:27,842 --> 00:59:29,177
What is that you got on?

761
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,845
What's what, man?

762
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:32,889
Yeah, that! What you got on.

763
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:34,265
This is a very, very,
very nice suit.

764
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:36,184
That's a very, very,
very nice suit, huh?

765
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:38,228
That's a clown suit. That's a costume...
Come on, man.

766
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:40,563
With a big sign on it
that says "Arrest Me."

767
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:43,858
You understand? You're too loud.
You're making too much noise. Look at me.

768
00:59:43,942 --> 00:59:48,488
The loudest one in the room is the weakest
one in the room. I told you that.

769
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:51,157
All right? What, are you trying
to be like Nicky Barnes, now?

770
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:52,742
What's your problem with Nicky, man?
I like Nicky.

771
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:54,411
I ain't got no problem with Nicky.
Oh, you like Nicky?

772
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:55,787
Yeah!
You want to be like Nicky?

773
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:58,581
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?

774
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,506
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?

775
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:01,626
He wants to talk to you.

776
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:04,587
Oh, so now you talking to him about me?
What? You...

777
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:06,214
About what? What is it about?
It ain't like that.

778
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:07,632
Then what is it like?
We were talking,

779
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:09,676
your name came up.
About what?

780
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:12,679
I don't know, man.
I told him I'd tell you.

781
01:00:14,472 --> 01:00:16,015
You know... Boy, you...

782
01:00:17,809 --> 01:00:20,520
You know, if you wasn't my brother,
I'd kill you. You know that, don't you?

783
01:00:20,603 --> 01:00:22,397
I'd blow your
motherfucking brains out.

784
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,481
Come on, man. Don't be like that.

785
01:00:23,565 --> 01:00:24,926
I'm taking you shopping this week.

786
01:00:24,983 --> 01:00:26,860
I went shopping.
I can tell.

787
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:29,654
See deep into you

788
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:34,659
And know what you're thinking now

789
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,955
And if I'm what you're needing

790
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:43,891
I need some kind of sign

791
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:49,980
Let me know,
'cause I can't read your mind

792
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:54,652
Are you in or am I
in this on my own?

793
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,154
I need some clue from you

794
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,657
It's a tax thing.

795
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:01,659
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,

796
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:05,120
but for the time being...
How much do you owe, Joe?

797
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,999
It's nothing. It's like...

798
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,334
Fifty grand.

799
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,837
You got it.

800
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,758
Thank you, man. Hey, I'm gonna
pay you back as soon as I...

801
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:21,261
Joe, this ain't no loan.
It's a gift. All right?

802
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,931
All you did for Bumpy, we owe you.

803
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,600
Keep your chin up. All right? Okay?

804
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:29,687
All you have which is down there. Down.
Chin down.

805
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,356
All right. Doc, will see you, okay?

806
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:36,276
You play it so cool

807
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,528
Hey!

808
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,948
You still owe me that dance, right?

809
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,449
Doc, come on.

810
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,952
Frank, check this.

811
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,297
How you doing?
Hi.

812
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:59,466
Frank Lucas.
Eva Kendo.

813
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,385
Nice to meet you, Eva.

814
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,387
Nice to meet you, Frank.

815
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,473
You're Frank and this is your place?

816
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:09,560
That's right.
I'm Frank and this is my place.

817
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,231
Why is it called Small's?
Why don't you call it Frank's?

818
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:19,236
When you own something,
you can call it what you want.

819
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,571
Small's.

820
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,532
Or Frank's. Frankie Small's.

821
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,659
Small's Frankie.

822
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,579
That's right.

823
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,165
You want to let my hand go?

824
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,834
Okay.

825
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,253
You leaving?

826
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,755
No, I was going to my table.

827
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,382
Okay. Need somebody to go with you?

828
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,719
- Yes?
Mmm-hmm.

829
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,304
All the cheesies.

830
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,191
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?

831
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,866
Wash your hands?
I got one print of that, don't smudge it.

832
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:54,396
Yeah.

833
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:56,023
There you go.

834
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:58,010
Hey, Spearman, what about him?
Who is that?

835
01:02:58,094 --> 01:03:00,221
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.

836
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:01,848
Yeah, yeah.
Put him up there by the big man.

837
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:03,349
He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo.

838
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:04,673
Yeah, but he's not as handsome.

839
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:06,894
- He looks more like your sister.
- Where's Ice Pick's mug?

840
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:08,059
Yeah, that's funny.

841
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:09,355
Maybe you guys
should take that show on the road.

842
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:11,858
So we need Ice Pick Paul.

843
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:13,317
- Ice Pick Paul?
- Sure. Yeah.

844
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:14,902
There you go. Get him up.

845
01:03:14,986 --> 01:03:17,613
Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.

846
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:21,117
No, Ice Pick Paul, he's a fucking
soldier. This guy's a lieutenant.

847
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,368
How's that even fucking possible?

848
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:24,537
That's Benny the Bishop.

849
01:03:25,413 --> 01:03:28,624
That guy is a soldier. This guy's
a lieutenant. No way that guy's on top.

850
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,501
You thinking
of Benny the Bishop.

851
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:33,504
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.

852
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:34,714
Jonesy's right.

853
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:38,509
Hey, which one of you guys has ever
actually seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

854
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:40,817
Actually seen it go down?

855
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:44,196
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place. Seen him handle drugs.

856
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,198
That rat, Ricky, has told us...

857
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,618
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.

858
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:51,912
He's dead.

859
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,289
All right, well,
we can take him off the fucking board.

860
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:58,836
I don't think we got any
solid evidence on anybody on that board.

861
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,381
What you saying, Richie?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

862
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:05,968
I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again from the street.

863
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,955
Hi, who's this?

864
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:25,292
Hello? Gabe? Yeah, it's Scott.
Yeah.

865
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,003
Scotty! What's going down, brother?

866
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,006
Those snow tires you gave me last night.
They come in yet?

867
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,843
Oh, the snow tires?
Yeah. I want some more of them.

868
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,429
Give me one-and-a-half more.
One-and-a-half,

869
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,932
that's a pretty big order.
Yeah, I want the big whitewalls,

870
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:43,393
they better get at least
100,000 miles.

871
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:47,522
All right, I'll tell you what.
You come in here tomorrow morning

872
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:50,942
I'm gonna set you up real nice
with a whitewall special, all right?

873
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:53,028
Thanks, bro.
No problem.

874
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:59,159
That's considerably more than
one year's salary, Richie.

875
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:05,456
If it disappears, I will not be
able to get it for you again.

876
01:08:05,457 --> 01:08:06,625
That's yours.

877
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:11,046
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.

878
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:17,928
It has to be Blue Magic, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be Blue.

879
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,137
You can pick it up here tomorrow.

880
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:20,222
$20,000.

881
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,099
Just leave it there.

882
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,156
How'd you do?
Good.

883
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,618
Here he comes.

884
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:43,161
That's him?
Yep.

885
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,081
That was quick.

886
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,136
Richie, if he goes in the city,
what do we fucking do?

887
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,846
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.

888
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:02,013
We stay with the money, all right?

889
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:03,390
We can't go in the fucking city.

890
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,308
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand in there, all right,

891
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:07,352
that I'm responsible for.
I ain't losing it.

892
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:09,062
It's out of ourjurisdiction!

893
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:11,827
- Follow the money!
- All right, all right, all right!

894
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:27,998
He's pulling over.

895
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,167
All right, here we go.

896
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,376
Let me out here.

897
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,630
Don't disappear, all right?

898
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:38,367
I'll circle the block.

899
01:09:38,368 --> 01:09:39,411
Move!

900
01:09:57,012 --> 01:10:00,348
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!

901
01:10:11,943 --> 01:10:15,030
Police Officer. I'm commandeering
your vehicle. Get out of the car.

902
01:10:15,697 --> 01:10:17,699
Who the fuck cares about you?
This is New York City, man.

903
01:10:17,782 --> 01:10:19,993
Get someone else's car!
Get out of the car.

904
01:10:20,076 --> 01:10:22,412
Come on, man.
Can't we live in peace...

905
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,890
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.

906
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,391
What?

907
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,811
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?

908
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:40,523
He's about to do something, huh?
He's going bowling?

909
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:42,901
Look at that. Strike.

910
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,236
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?

911
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,987
Nothing.
Get up, you fucker. Get the fuck up!

912
01:12:46,071 --> 01:12:47,155
Knock it off.

913
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:48,615
Shut the fuck up!
What did I tell you?

914
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:49,824
Keep your fucking head down.

915
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:50,992
Shut up! Whose bag is this?

916
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,077
- What're you doing?
- Sit down and shut up!

917
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,370
Don't you move!

918
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,551
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!

919
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,972
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts,
from Newark.

920
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:15,767
That's my money.

921
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:19,229
What the fuck?
What money, huh? What money?

922
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,190
The bills are sequenced, right?

923
01:13:22,274 --> 01:13:25,515
They're registered with the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office. Just check them out.

924
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,571
They all start with CF3500.
Have a look.

925
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,161
Fucking registers.

926
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:38,581
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

927
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:41,626
Honest mistake.
I'll just get the money.

928
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:45,213
This time.
All right.

929
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:48,133
There it is. All right.
Thank you.

930
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:51,553
When was the last time I was
in Jersey? Let me think.

931
01:13:53,138 --> 01:13:54,347
Never.

932
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,435
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?

933
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:01,521
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?

934
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,442
You got your fucking money, Richie.

935
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:10,405
And never, ever come into
this city again unannounced.

936
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,866
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,

937
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,119
you call ahead first,
see if it's okay with me.

938
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,414
No problem. All right.

939
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:26,421
- Let's go, hit some balls.
- Great suits, pal.

940
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,966
Is that your car?

941
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:32,510
That's a fucking great car.

942
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:35,138
Have a nice fucking
trip back to Jersey.

943
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,389
RICHIE; All right.

944
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:39,017
Come on, I got a tee time.
Let's go.

945
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:44,731
What were you doin' there?

946
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:48,360
Well, that's where this dope is coming from.
Blue Magic, it's coming out of New York.

947
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:50,070
What do you expect
me to do, ignore it?

948
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:53,448
The cab driver has filed aggravated
assault and grand theft charges

949
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:54,908
which he may reconsider

950
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:58,536
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey offers to settle.

951
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:02,082
I showed him my ID.
I told him I was a cop.

952
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,836
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.

953
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,963
I was chasing the twenty
grand, all right?

954
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,217
Next time, knock him out
before you show him your badge.

955
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:17,722
Look, I don't want to hear
about you going into New York again.

956
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,559
Well, then this investigation's over.
You're not listening to me.

957
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,937
I said, "I don't want to hear about
you going into New York again."

958
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,731
You do whatever you have to do.
You go wherever you have to go

959
01:15:26,815 --> 01:15:29,401
to figure out who's bringing
this shit into the country.

960
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,151
Just don't tell me about it.

961
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,273
Just don't tell me about it.

962
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:38,326
There's your girl, right there.

963
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,457
Hey, how'd you do?
Hi.

964
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,626
I didn't keep you waiting long, did I?
No. Fine.

965
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,879
Good. A woman as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.

966
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,757
For anything.

967
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,765
Thank you, ma'am.
You as pretty as ever.

968
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,522
Hey, Doc.
Tommy!

969
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,899
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.

970
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:12,861
Sure. Sure do make father proud.
All right.

971
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:25,948
This is your father?

972
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:28,609
That's Martin Luther King.

973
01:16:29,443 --> 01:16:31,362
It is not.
It is. It is Martin Luther King.

974
01:16:31,445 --> 01:16:32,905
You know, "I have a dream"?

975
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,281
Of course.

976
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:36,200
No, that's...

977
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:39,870
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.

978
01:16:39,953 --> 01:16:41,789
What did he do?

979
01:16:41,872 --> 01:16:47,419
Did a lot of things. He was a friend
and served New York. New York sewed him.

980
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,631
He was my boss.

981
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:52,216
My teacher.

982
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:53,801
What did he teach you?

983
01:16:53,884 --> 01:16:56,220
He taught me a lot of things.

984
01:16:58,389 --> 01:17:00,641
He taught me how
to take my time.

985
01:17:01,975 --> 01:17:06,647
Taught me that if I was going to do
something, to do it with care, with love.

986
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,482
Anything else?

987
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,072
He taught me to be a gentleman.

988
01:17:15,155 --> 01:17:16,240
That's what you are?

989
01:17:16,323 --> 01:17:18,534
That's what I try to be. Come here.

990
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,995
Come here. Sit right here.

991
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,582
Look at me.

992
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:29,545
I own about five
apartments in Manhattan.

993
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:32,163
Homes all over the East Coast,

994
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:34,967
I could have taken you to any
one of them, but I didn't.

995
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,051
I brought you here.

996
01:17:36,135 --> 01:17:37,678
Frank, I was looking for you, boy.

997
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:39,805
Because I wanted you
to meet my mother.

998
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,473
How you doing, Ma?

999
01:17:41,557 --> 01:17:42,725
Is this her?

1000
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:44,393
- Eva, this is my mother.
- Hi, Eva.

1001
01:17:44,476 --> 01:17:45,644
Oh!

1002
01:17:45,728 --> 01:17:47,104
Nice to meet you.

1003
01:17:47,187 --> 01:17:48,856
- She's beautiful!
- Yeah?

1004
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:53,944
Look at her, Frank.
She's an angel come down from heaven.

1005
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:55,487
Thank you.

1006
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:06,206
Mr. Roberts?
I'm here for our appointment.

1007
01:18:10,961 --> 01:18:12,671
Morning.
Morning.

1008
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:16,967
Sorry. Our appointment?

1009
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,927
Child Social Services.

1010
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:36,278
She did mention your name, though.

1011
01:18:36,361 --> 01:18:37,529
The stewardess?

1012
01:18:37,613 --> 01:18:39,531
No, not the stewardess.

1013
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:43,827
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.

1014
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:47,956
Right after she asked me
if I associated with any criminals.

1015
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,999
All right, go! Go, go!

1016
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:50,292
Yeah! You wanna see this?
Go, go.

1017
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,960
Hey, boys.

1018
01:18:52,044 --> 01:18:53,879
Joey. Hey, Joey!

1019
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,881
Get in the pool. Go on.

1020
01:18:56,882 --> 01:18:58,634
Come on. Come on.

1021
01:19:02,888 --> 01:19:04,932
So, how'd she get my name?

1022
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:06,475
Laurie.
Hmm.

1023
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,853
She's been saying a lot lately.

1024
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:11,897
A lot.

1025
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:18,278
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,

1026
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:19,571
I took it very seriously.

1027
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,573
I know.
I know and I appreciate that.

1028
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:24,618
And I said yes, I would take
on this responsibility.

1029
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:27,287
Take care of your son, if God
forbid, something happened to you.

1030
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:30,290
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to Child Social Services

1031
01:19:30,374 --> 01:19:33,085
made me look really bad, all right.
You know,

1032
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:37,464
out at all kinds of hours at night time,
lowlife informants around, women.

1033
01:19:37,548 --> 01:19:39,466
Old friends like me.

1034
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,469
Old friends like you, yeah.

1035
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:46,181
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?

1036
01:19:49,726 --> 01:19:51,353
Okay, I understand.

1037
01:19:51,436 --> 01:19:55,482
They ask me, I'll tell them what you
want me to tell them. I'll lie for you.

1038
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:57,776
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.

1039
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,029
Just, omit certain details.

1040
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:03,448
Sure. All right.

1041
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:07,822
You know, there's something else
I was gonna ask you.

1042
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:11,665
Something else.
You don't have to answer if you don't want.

1043
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,752
Blue Magic. Anything?

1044
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:22,092
Just a lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work, that's all.

1045
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:24,636
What, your guys?

1046
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,054
Just guys.

1047
01:20:27,514 --> 01:20:30,309
You thinking about where
it's coming from?

1048
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,936
Guys down south.
That's all I heard.

1049
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:35,397
Cubans?
I don't know.

1050
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:37,858
Not Mexico.

1051
01:20:38,525 --> 01:20:39,693
I don't know.

1052
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,237
You're telling me,
it's coming in from South America?

1053
01:20:42,362 --> 01:20:43,906
I don't know.

1054
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,661
All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're
upsetting the natural order of things.

1055
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:51,705
And that's all there is.

1056
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:07,930
What's up?

1057
01:21:08,055 --> 01:21:09,890
My man, how we looking?

1058
01:22:38,478 --> 01:22:40,981
Frank, I want you to
meet Mike Sobota.

1059
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:42,733
How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
How are you?

1060
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,859
What can I get you?

1061
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:46,028
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me, your nephew.

1062
01:22:46,111 --> 01:22:48,691
Oh, this is the... Yankees, yeah.
Hey, Steve!

1063
01:22:48,717 --> 01:22:49,389
Yankees.

1064
01:22:49,489 --> 01:22:50,907
Steve! Come here.
Excuse me one second.

1065
01:22:50,991 --> 01:22:52,909
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him on the Yankees.

1066
01:22:52,993 --> 01:22:54,077
'Cause you good enough,
ain't you?

1067
01:22:54,161 --> 01:22:56,288
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day, Jack.

1068
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:58,165
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,

1069
01:22:58,290 --> 01:22:59,708
make it a good day,
you understand?

1070
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:04,129
NYPD, excuse me, Police Department.
Back up, baby.

1071
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:07,257
- Whoa!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1072
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,134
Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
Uh-uh.

1073
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,428
Taking your ass in.
Where are the handcuffs?

1074
01:23:11,511 --> 01:23:13,555
I got a license for that,
motherfucker.

1075
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,808
You got a license for this?
Excuse me, all right?

1076
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:20,979
Shit. All right! Yeah!

1077
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,898
Now, you know what?
I gotta arrest you for that shit.

1078
01:23:22,981 --> 01:23:24,149
That shit's too good
to be on the street.

1079
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:28,070
Wait a minute, I got this for you.
You ain't got to arrest nobody.

1080
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:29,821
Are you bribing me now?

1081
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:32,532
I'll tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody!

1082
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:34,451
Now, all you're under arrest!
You first!

1083
01:23:34,534 --> 01:23:36,119
That's my family.
That's my...

1084
01:23:36,203 --> 01:23:38,038
Excuse me, excuse me.

1085
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:41,500
Back it up, baby.

1086
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,667
What was that?

1087
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,461
Come on, guys.
What's the matter with you, man?

1088
01:23:44,544 --> 01:23:46,129
I said, what the hell was that?
What was what?

1089
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:47,839
I said what the hell are you doing, man?
Be cool, man!

1090
01:23:47,923 --> 01:23:49,132
What's your fucking problem?

1091
01:23:49,216 --> 01:23:50,967
What the hell's wrong with you?

1092
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:52,886
Goddamn!

1093
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:56,181
He's all right.
I just shot him in the leg, is all.

1094
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,100
Damn, Jimmy!

1095
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:00,185
Get up.

1096
01:24:13,865 --> 01:24:16,576
All right, everybody, get out!
Get out!

1097
01:24:17,744 --> 01:24:19,246
Come on,
Frank, it was an accident.

1098
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:20,705
It wasn't no goddamn accident.
He feels terrible.

1099
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:24,501
He don't feel shit, 'cause he's coked
up all the motherfucking time!

1100
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:26,711
He's your driver.
Get rid of him.

1101
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:27,796
Come on, man,
that's your cousin!

1102
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:30,006
That ain't shit to me!
He don't mean nothing to me.

1103
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:32,731
What's he gonna do, go back home?
I don't give a damn what he does!

1104
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:34,845
Send his ass home! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1105
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:38,473
Hey! Don't rub on that! You blot that!
You understand? That's alpaca!

1106
01:24:38,557 --> 01:24:42,018
That's $25,000 alpaca!
You blot that shit!

1107
01:24:42,102 --> 01:24:44,354
You don't rub it!
Put the club soda on there.

1108
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:46,398
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

1109
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,693
Listen, from now on, don't nobody
talk to me directly! You understand?

1110
01:24:49,776 --> 01:24:53,488
You got business with me, you talk to Huey!
Huey, you talk to me! You got it?

1111
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:56,032
All right.
Damn it, never on the phone! You got it?

1112
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:57,367
I got it.
All right!

1113
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,870
And take them goddamn
sunglasses off.

1114
01:24:59,953 --> 01:25:01,538
Take the goddamn sunglasses off!

1115
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:03,248
Damn it, man.

1116
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,836
Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.

1117
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:25,812
The whole place was imported.

1118
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:27,814
Brick by brick.

1119
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:30,567
Gloucestershire.

1120
01:25:31,276 --> 01:25:33,320
Who?
Great Britain.

1121
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:35,280
Yours.

1122
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:41,828
Here you go.

1123
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,375
Pull!

1124
01:25:53,006 --> 01:25:54,674
Come, Eva.

1125
01:25:55,508 --> 01:25:58,803
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.

1126
01:26:02,307 --> 01:26:04,851
Of course. Excuse me.

1127
01:26:06,019 --> 01:26:09,231
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1128
01:26:12,817 --> 01:26:15,153
What do you think of monopolies?

1129
01:26:16,363 --> 01:26:17,530
You mean like the game?

1130
01:26:17,656 --> 01:26:21,284
No, I just think monopolies were
made illegal in the country, Frank,

1131
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:23,620
'cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.

1132
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:26,748
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1133
01:26:26,873 --> 01:26:29,459
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,

1134
01:26:29,542 --> 01:26:31,586
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.

1135
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:33,171
Just trying to make a living.

1136
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:37,842
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right. It's America.

1137
01:26:38,176 --> 01:26:42,389
We just can't do it at the
unreasonable expense of others.

1138
01:26:42,722 --> 01:26:44,808
'Cause then it becomes un-American.

1139
01:26:44,891 --> 01:26:46,935
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk

1140
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:48,812
could never represent
the true cost of production

1141
01:26:48,895 --> 01:26:53,400
'cause it's got to be controlled.
It's gotta be set. It's gotta be fair.

1142
01:26:53,483 --> 01:26:55,986
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that I think is fair.

1143
01:26:56,069 --> 01:26:57,430
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?

1144
01:26:57,487 --> 01:26:58,989
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.

1145
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,074
I mean, I know
your customers are happy, Frank,

1146
01:27:01,157 --> 01:27:03,910
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.

1147
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:08,540
But we fellow dairy farmers out here,
Frank, are you thinking of us?

1148
01:27:09,207 --> 01:27:11,001
You thinking of them?

1149
01:27:11,084 --> 01:27:13,128
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.

1150
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:18,008
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've ever thought about me.

1151
01:27:18,091 --> 01:27:20,427
I'm just thinking out loud now.

1152
01:27:20,927 --> 01:27:25,265
If you took some of your inventory,
Frank, and you sold it wholesale...

1153
01:27:27,267 --> 01:27:28,310
Sit.

1154
01:27:29,185 --> 01:27:32,564
We could work.
We could do some distribution.

1155
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,275
I don't know.
I'm pretty good, Dominic.

1156
01:27:35,358 --> 01:27:39,362
You know, I got 110th, 155th,
river to river. I'm all right.

1157
01:27:39,446 --> 01:27:42,365
That's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what I'm talking about.

1158
01:27:42,449 --> 01:27:44,169
I mean, let's go at least
bigger than Kmart.

1159
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:49,122
I'm talking about LA, Chicago, Detroit,
Las Vegas. Let's go nationwide, huh?

1160
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:53,960
I'm gonna guarantee you your peace
of mind here. You don't want that?

1161
01:27:55,211 --> 01:27:57,172
You're going to need it.

1162
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:59,174
I don't know how you
view me, you know.

1163
01:27:59,257 --> 01:28:01,134
I'm kind of a
Renaissance man, Frank.

1164
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:03,219
You know, the people I deal
with on a daily basis,

1165
01:28:03,303 --> 01:28:05,180
you know, they're not
enlightened, Frank.

1166
01:28:05,263 --> 01:28:08,058
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.

1167
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:09,726
They're not open to change.

1168
01:28:09,809 --> 01:28:13,355
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.

1169
01:28:13,563 --> 01:28:16,775
I talk to them,
there's just no misunderstandings.

1170
01:28:18,276 --> 01:28:21,321
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.

1171
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:28,995
You're paying, what, $75,000,
$80,000 a kilo?

1172
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:33,458
I'm a Renaissance man, too.

1173
01:28:34,584 --> 01:28:36,461
I'll consider $50,000.

1174
01:28:45,178 --> 01:28:48,431
Why would you trust these people?
And the way they look at you...

1175
01:28:48,515 --> 01:28:50,892
They look at me like
it's Christmas and I'm Santa Claus.

1176
01:28:50,975 --> 01:28:53,520
They look at us like we're the help.

1177
01:28:54,312 --> 01:28:56,189
They work for me now.

1178
01:29:01,152 --> 01:29:01,611
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

1179
01:29:01,612 --> 01:29:03,488
I predict that
when I meet Joe Frazier,

1180
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:07,909
this will be like a good amateur
fighting a real professional.

1181
01:29:07,992 --> 01:29:10,495
This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...

1182
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:12,997
That's gonna be Ali in like three.

1183
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,125
You're not fighting Oscar Bonavena,

1184
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:16,584
you're not fighting Sonny Liston.

1185
01:29:16,668 --> 01:29:17,789
You're fighting Joe Frazier.

1186
01:29:17,794 --> 01:29:19,462
Everybody knows that.
That's not the point.

1187
01:29:19,546 --> 01:29:20,880
He's all talk, man.

1188
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:23,324
- Look at Frazier!
- Ali gonna crush him, baby.

1189
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:24,342
I'll stop him.

1190
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:25,760
Stop me? You?

1191
01:29:25,844 --> 01:29:27,137
How soon? What round?

1192
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,765
- Don't let him obligate you.
- One to 10!

1193
01:29:30,849 --> 01:29:35,728
Tonight, March 8, 1971.
Here we are at Madison Square Garden

1194
01:29:35,812 --> 01:29:37,313
for the Fight of the Century.

1195
01:29:37,397 --> 01:29:40,608
And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.

1196
01:29:40,692 --> 01:29:45,155
There are handshakes and, of course,
there are utterly beautiful women.

1197
01:29:45,238 --> 01:29:47,407
But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,

1198
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:52,162
you can feel the atmosphere is so heavy
with tension, it's almost unbearable.

1199
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:54,873
Everybody who is anybody is here.

1200
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:58,835
Like Sinatra. Like Graziano,
David Frost and Diahann Carroll.

1201
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:02,755
And Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.
The celebrities are pouring in.

1202
01:30:02,839 --> 01:30:06,968
The way you all build it up,
Life magazine cover, Time magazine,

1203
01:30:07,051 --> 01:30:11,097
everybody gives their opinion.
Dempsey says I'll lose. Joe Louis...

1204
01:30:11,181 --> 01:30:14,601
And when Joe Louis said I'm gonna lose,
that's how I knew I'd won this one.

1205
01:30:14,684 --> 01:30:17,687
Joe Louis always
picks the wrong man!

1206
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:19,898
Always picks the wrong man.

1207
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:22,942
Joe Louis is here tonight.
Watch your ass.

1208
01:30:23,026 --> 01:30:26,446
The official weight of
Joe Frazier is 205.5 pounds.

1209
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:28,615
Oh.

1210
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,119
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1211
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:35,580
You're not watching the fight, Bob?

1212
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:37,582
I'm not into boxing.

1213
01:30:38,374 --> 01:30:40,710
This ain't boxing, kid.

1214
01:30:40,793 --> 01:30:42,504
It's politics.

1215
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,509
I got something for you, too.

1216
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:49,093
Yeah

1217
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:53,389
The coat? For me?

1218
01:30:53,473 --> 01:30:54,599
Mmm-hmm.

1219
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:56,851
Do you like it?

1220
01:30:56,935 --> 01:30:59,270
The coat? Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

1221
01:31:02,232 --> 01:31:04,067
What do you think?
Yeah.

1222
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:05,944
You sure?
Yeah.

1223
01:31:13,493 --> 01:31:15,078
Over here, Sammy.

1224
01:31:15,161 --> 01:31:17,580
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.

1225
01:31:19,624 --> 01:31:21,084
Joe Louis! Over here!

1226
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:22,502
How's it going, Frank?

1227
01:31:22,585 --> 01:31:24,170
How are you, Joe?

1228
01:31:33,346 --> 01:31:38,184
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
we have quite a list of introductions.

1229
01:31:38,351 --> 01:31:43,690
We are now going to introduce people
from all endeavors of life.

1230
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:46,317
And not just show people.

1231
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:49,487
Because everyone is here tonight!

1232
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:03,209
Main event!

1233
01:32:05,378 --> 01:32:07,213
Fifteen rounds.

1234
01:32:07,297 --> 01:32:12,343
For the undisputed
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

1235
01:32:12,427 --> 01:32:13,511
There we go, Ali!

1236
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:17,181
From Louisville, Kentucky,
he's wearing red trunks.

1237
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,641
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.

1238
01:32:18,725 --> 01:32:20,727
He weighs 215 pounds.

1239
01:32:21,894 --> 01:32:25,565
Here is Muhammad Ali!

1240
01:32:26,816 --> 01:32:30,903
His opponent,
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

1241
01:32:31,321 --> 01:32:33,615
he's wearing green trunks.

1242
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,075
Who's that laughing with Cattano?

1243
01:32:36,743 --> 01:32:38,828
How'd he get so fucking
close to the ring?

1244
01:32:38,911 --> 01:32:42,040
The Heavyweight
Champion of the World,

1245
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:45,084
Joe Frazier!

1246
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:50,798
Hey, Frank.
You gonna keep that hat on all night?

1247
01:32:50,923 --> 01:32:51,966
I'm gonna miss the fight.

1248
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:53,801
You paid for it.

1249
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,723
Joe, over here!

1250
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:41,057
This guy, he's a supplier
at most. Or just a pimp.

1251
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:42,300
Otherwise we'd know his name.

1252
01:33:42,308 --> 01:33:46,145
His tickets were phenomenal.
Better seats than Dominic Cattano. Right?

1253
01:33:46,771 --> 01:33:48,815
Joe Louis shook his hand.

1254
01:33:49,816 --> 01:33:51,859
Who the fuck is this guy?

1255
01:33:55,655 --> 01:33:57,031
What's this?

1256
01:33:57,156 --> 01:33:59,367
That's the plate off the limo.

1257
01:33:59,492 --> 01:34:01,452
Check with the company
who rented it.

1258
01:34:04,956 --> 01:34:08,042
Right there,
Mr. Lucas. Right there. Good.

1259
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:11,921
Can I get a
shot here, Frank? Right here.

1260
01:34:12,004 --> 01:34:13,506
Looking good, Frank.

1261
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:15,341
Beautiful.

1262
01:34:17,301 --> 01:34:18,720
Right on, Frank!

1263
01:34:18,803 --> 01:34:20,513
Congratulations!

1264
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,271
She's the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

1265
01:34:28,354 --> 01:34:31,983
That's my sunshine right there,
Mr. Williams. I wish Bumpy had met her.

1266
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,443
Throw it to me!

1267
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:39,949
Get a picture.

1268
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:51,419
Come here, baby.

1269
01:35:16,194 --> 01:35:18,404
- What's happening?
- Sit tight.

1270
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:22,241
Congratulations, Frank.

1271
01:35:22,366 --> 01:35:23,534
Detective.

1272
01:35:23,618 --> 01:35:26,913
So, you sure you done the right thing?
I mean, she's a beautiful girl and all...

1273
01:35:27,121 --> 01:35:29,290
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

1274
01:35:30,249 --> 01:35:32,293
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,

1275
01:35:32,418 --> 01:35:34,938
understand this is the most important
day of my life, Detective.

1276
01:35:35,046 --> 01:35:36,547
Oh, I understand. I understand.

1277
01:35:36,631 --> 01:35:39,133
You know, a man who walks around
in a $50,000 chinchilla coat

1278
01:35:39,217 --> 01:35:41,427
and never even bought
me a cup of coffee.

1279
01:35:41,552 --> 01:35:44,931
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?

1280
01:35:46,307 --> 01:35:47,350
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1281
01:35:47,433 --> 01:35:48,476
Do you pay your bills, I asked you?

1282
01:35:48,559 --> 01:35:49,685
If you're not getting your share,

1283
01:35:49,769 --> 01:35:51,187
maybe you need
to talk to the Chief of Police.

1284
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:54,732
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even fucking know me.

1285
01:35:55,441 --> 01:35:56,692
Maybe I'm special.

1286
01:35:56,776 --> 01:35:58,653
You are special.

1287
01:35:58,778 --> 01:36:00,404
You see that right there?

1288
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:02,782
Special Investigations Unit.

1289
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:05,284
Special.

1290
01:36:06,118 --> 01:36:08,079
Get it?

1291
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:13,042
Ten grand. First of each month.
Deliver it right here.

1292
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,711
Are you done?
Oh, yeah, I'm done.

1293
01:36:18,756 --> 01:36:21,884
Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.

1294
01:36:21,968 --> 01:36:23,302
Let's go.

1295
01:37:22,904 --> 01:37:24,572
His name is Frank Lucas.

1296
01:37:24,655 --> 01:37:27,491
Originally from Greensboro,
North Carolina.

1297
01:37:27,575 --> 01:37:32,622
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and unlicensed firearm.

1298
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:37,335
For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's
driver, bodyguard and collector.

1299
01:37:39,045 --> 01:37:40,963
He was with him when he died.

1300
01:37:41,047 --> 01:37:45,885
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest. And a lot of cousins.

1301
01:37:46,969 --> 01:37:48,090
They all living up here now,

1302
01:37:48,137 --> 01:37:51,015
spread throughout the
five boroughs and Jersey.

1303
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:53,351
The brothers are Dexter,

1304
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:55,645
in Brooklyn. He's a dry cleaner.
What can I do for you?

1305
01:37:55,728 --> 01:37:58,439
- I'm picking up.
- Yeah.

1306
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:02,735
Melvin in Queens has got a
custom furniture and fire doors business.

1307
01:38:03,945 --> 01:38:05,112
That's it right here?
Right there.

1308
01:38:05,237 --> 01:38:08,449
Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store.

1309
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:11,953
Turner in the Bronx
has got a tire shop.

1310
01:38:13,579 --> 01:38:16,374
And Huey Lucas in Bergen County
has a body shop.

1311
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,250
Ls your manager here?
That's my price.

1312
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:19,961
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?

1313
01:38:20,086 --> 01:38:23,172
These businesses are
the distribution and collection points

1314
01:38:23,255 --> 01:38:25,007
for Frank's dope and Frank's money.

1315
01:38:26,342 --> 01:38:31,889
Everything about Frank's life seems
unpretentious, orderly and legitimate.

1316
01:38:32,598 --> 01:38:35,142
He starts early,
gets up at 5:00 a.m.

1317
01:38:35,226 --> 01:38:39,021
Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem
every morning, usually by himself.

1318
01:38:39,105 --> 01:38:40,189
Then he starts work.

1319
01:38:40,272 --> 01:38:43,734
Takes a meeting with the accountant
or with his lawyer.

1320
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:47,071
At nights, he usually stays at home.
And if he does go out,

1321
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:51,200
it's to one of two clubs or a handful
of restaurants with his new wife.

1322
01:38:51,283 --> 01:38:53,283
Some ball players.
That's fucking Wilt Chamberlain.

1323
01:38:53,285 --> 01:38:57,581
Friends, musicians.
Never, never with organized crime guys.

1324
01:38:57,665 --> 01:39:00,459
Sundays, he takes his
mother to church.

1325
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,503
Then he drives out
and he changes

1326
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:06,632
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.

1327
01:39:07,466 --> 01:39:10,302
Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man, Richie.

1328
01:39:10,428 --> 01:39:11,512
No.

1329
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:15,474
Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical
either, and he ran Harlem for years.

1330
01:39:15,558 --> 01:39:19,061
So you're saying that
Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?

1331
01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:20,646
- Yeah.
- His driver?

1332
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:23,315
- Yeah.
- Sounds a little farfetched.

1333
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:25,985
But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...

1334
01:39:26,068 --> 01:39:27,236
He's handing out turkeys, man.

1335
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:29,739
he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?

1336
01:39:29,822 --> 01:39:32,908
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?

1337
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,077
The guy he sees every day.

1338
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:37,496
It's like a Sicilian family.

1339
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:41,709
He's structured his organization
to protect him in the same way.

1340
01:39:41,792 --> 01:39:43,232
And if he was with
Bumpy for so long,

1341
01:39:43,294 --> 01:39:45,921
that means he would have
spent a lot of time with Italians.

1342
01:39:46,005 --> 01:39:48,841
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.

1343
01:39:48,924 --> 01:39:53,179
But here's the thing. I don't think
it's Frank Lucas that we're after.

1344
01:39:53,262 --> 01:39:56,265
Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas
is working for.

1345
01:39:56,518 --> 01:39:58,478
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.

1346
01:39:58,562 --> 01:40:05,193
Okay. So what do you have on him that will
stick in court? Because this isn't it.

1347
01:40:06,653 --> 01:40:10,490
Without powder, without informants,
no one's going to jail.

1348
01:40:10,991 --> 01:40:12,191
That's understood, sir.

1349
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,620
And I don't think we're gonna get
informants, not from inside the family,

1350
01:40:15,704 --> 01:40:18,498
you know, unless we
get very, very lucky.

1351
01:40:22,294 --> 01:40:27,132
Straight up lab tests suggesting
purity's consistent with Asian dope.

1352
01:40:28,091 --> 01:40:31,178
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other Europeans

1353
01:40:31,261 --> 01:40:33,221
or with the Turks.

1354
01:40:34,056 --> 01:40:39,353
We got small blue packets turning up in
neighborhoods all over the Tri-State area.

1355
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:42,189
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights

1356
01:40:42,272 --> 01:40:44,441
Richmond Avenue and Staten Island.

1357
01:40:44,524 --> 01:40:47,361
They got North Orange,
Princeton, Bayonne, Newark,

1358
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:51,948
Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo,
and all the way through Connecticut.

1359
01:40:52,074 --> 01:40:54,034
The same dope.

1360
01:40:57,329 --> 01:40:58,455
All right.

1361
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:03,751
That's it, down there.

1362
01:41:23,104 --> 01:41:25,023
And it's Three Counts
as they round the turn for home now.

1363
01:41:48,463 --> 01:41:50,673
Okay, let's all join hands.

1364
01:41:54,969 --> 01:41:57,722
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,

1365
01:41:57,805 --> 01:41:59,724
the nourishments of our bodies.

1366
01:41:59,807 --> 01:42:04,270
Feed our souls with heavenly grace,
in Jesus' name and for His sake.

1367
01:42:04,687 --> 01:42:06,481
- Amen.
- Amen.

1368
01:42:25,124 --> 01:42:26,793
Shh. Shh.

1369
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:30,004
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. Come on, now.

1370
01:42:31,464 --> 01:42:32,632
It's okay.

1371
01:42:33,841 --> 01:42:37,678
You better get yourself ready, old man.
Come on, big man. Throw the ball.

1372
01:42:37,804 --> 01:42:40,389
Get yourself ready, old man.
All right!

1373
01:42:40,473 --> 01:42:43,267
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you. Come on!

1374
01:42:43,351 --> 01:42:45,937
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.

1375
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:48,606
Hey! Watch your mouth, boy.
Throw the ball!

1376
01:42:48,689 --> 01:42:51,526
Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder!

1377
01:42:51,651 --> 01:42:53,694
Steve. Steve, come here.

1378
01:42:54,987 --> 01:42:55,988
Come, sit down.

1379
01:42:56,072 --> 01:42:58,491
Uncle Frank.
What's happening?

1380
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,618
How you doing?

1381
01:43:00,701 --> 01:43:01,702
Cool.

1382
01:43:01,828 --> 01:43:03,121
You want a drink?

1383
01:43:03,204 --> 01:43:04,789
You know better than that.

1384
01:43:04,872 --> 01:43:06,374
Just checking.

1385
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:11,963
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?

1386
01:43:12,713 --> 01:43:15,842
I set it up with the
Yankees and Billy Martin.

1387
01:43:17,718 --> 01:43:19,720
Why didn't you show up?

1388
01:43:22,056 --> 01:43:23,724
Don't lie to me.

1389
01:43:24,308 --> 01:43:26,853
I don't want to play
ball no more.

1390
01:43:27,395 --> 01:43:28,479
I decided.
What you talking about?

1391
01:43:28,563 --> 01:43:30,648
You decided?
Decided what?

1392
01:43:30,731 --> 01:43:32,567
That ain't what I want.
What you talking about?

1393
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:34,026
You've been playing
since you was a little boy.

1394
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:35,951
You were ready to go into the pros.
What you...

1395
01:43:35,987 --> 01:43:38,322
Frank! We got a problem, man.

1396
01:43:41,576 --> 01:43:43,244
What do you want?

1397
01:43:44,745 --> 01:43:47,248
I want what you got, Uncle Frank.

1398
01:43:47,331 --> 01:43:49,083
I want to be you.

1399
01:44:08,952 --> 01:44:12,413
He's been diluting it so much.
We're down 2%, 3% pure.

1400
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:15,041
And you tested it? You're sure?

1401
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,209
Yeah.

1402
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:22,423
Fuck you looking at?

1403
01:45:14,559 --> 01:45:16,186
My man.

1404
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,272
Welcome, Frank.
How you doing, Nick?

1405
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:22,317
It's all great. Welcome.

1406
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:25,236
I need to talk to you.
Great. Come on.

1407
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:30,033
Hey, you all, everybody get out!
Let's go. Come on! Hurry up!

1408
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,953
Sit, my brother.

1409
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,665
I take it you talked to Charlie.

1410
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,169
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.

1411
01:45:41,252 --> 01:45:42,795
Let me explain to you...
No, no, no.

1412
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:45,840
I'm all right.
That's not what I came here for, Nick.

1413
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:48,718
Yeah, everybody's good, Nick.

1414
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:51,846
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,

1415
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:54,015
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy except you.

1416
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:56,684
I'm happy, Frank.
You happy? Really?

1417
01:45:56,768 --> 01:46:00,230
Well, maybe I'm the one with the problem.
Yeah, go on. Get one.

1418
01:46:00,313 --> 01:46:01,397
All right.

1419
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:02,815
I gotta problem 'cause

1420
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:07,237
I don't understand why you gotta take
something that's perfectly good

1421
01:46:07,362 --> 01:46:09,030
and mess it up.

1422
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,783
See, brand names.
Brand names mean something. Understand?

1423
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,494
Shut the fuck up!

1424
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:18,665
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm sorry about that bullshit.

1425
01:46:18,748 --> 01:46:20,166
Blue Magic.

1426
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:24,337
That's a brand name.
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name.

1427
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:27,173
I stand behind it. I guarantee it.

1428
01:46:27,257 --> 01:46:29,425
They know that, even if they
don't know me anymore than

1429
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:32,095
they know the chairman
of General Mills.

1430
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,513
What the fuck are you
talking about, Frank?

1431
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:36,474
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down

1432
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:41,229
to one, two, three, four, five percent
and then you call it Blue Magic,

1433
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:44,482
that is trademark infringement.
You understand what I'm saying?

1434
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:47,068
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.

1435
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,444
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.

1436
01:46:48,528 --> 01:46:50,780
If I buy a car, and I wanna paint it,
I can paint the motherfucker.

1437
01:46:50,905 --> 01:46:52,031
Yeah, but you don't have to.

1438
01:46:52,115 --> 01:46:55,159
This is what I'm saying to you, Nick, you
don't have to. Good enough the way it is.

1439
01:46:55,243 --> 01:46:58,079
You can make enough money off it the way
it is, just by calling it Blue Magic.

1440
01:46:58,162 --> 01:46:59,998
Anything more than
that is greed, son.

1441
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:02,000
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change the name on it?

1442
01:47:02,083 --> 01:47:04,127
I would have to insist
that you change the name.

1443
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:08,089
Fine by me, Frank. I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that don't sound as good.

1444
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:11,052
I don't give a fuck what you call it.
Put a chokehold on the motherfucker

1445
01:47:11,134 --> 01:47:13,761
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?

1446
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:18,099
I don't care, just don't let
me catch you doing this again.

1447
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,852
Catch me? Infringement?
Insist?

1448
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,770
I don't like these
words as much as,

1449
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:25,606
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."

1450
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:27,859
These are better words you use to come
to my motherfucking club

1451
01:47:27,942 --> 01:47:30,528
without an invitation! You hear me?

1452
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,780
My man.

1453
01:47:41,331 --> 01:47:44,334
Oh, shit. Fuck,
is that the cops there, man?

1454
01:47:53,343 --> 01:47:54,969
It's all right.

1455
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:58,973
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?

1456
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:01,351
Stuff's in the car, Frank.

1457
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,270
What?

1458
01:48:04,354 --> 01:48:06,522
Some of it's in the trunk.

1459
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:09,984
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing, Detective?

1460
01:48:10,068 --> 01:48:11,527
How was your Thanksgiving?

1461
01:48:11,611 --> 01:48:14,252
Not so good, as a matter of fact.
Why don't you get out of the car?

1462
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:20,703
Come on, give me the fucking keys.

1463
01:48:20,787 --> 01:48:23,039
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone, Frank.

1464
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,540
The Shelby's gone?
Stay right there.

1465
01:48:24,624 --> 01:48:26,542
Yes, sir. Right here.

1466
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:29,212
You got anything
worth looking at in here?

1467
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:31,047
Hey, that's that Trupo guy.

1468
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:32,715
- SPEARMANI Is that him?
- Yeah.

1469
01:48:32,799 --> 01:48:34,300
Fucking prick.

1470
01:48:37,512 --> 01:48:39,972
Come over here a minute, Frank.
Yeah.

1471
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:43,309
What are we gonna do about this?

1472
01:48:43,393 --> 01:48:45,812
We don't do shit about it. We close
it up, throw it back in the trunk,

1473
01:48:45,895 --> 01:48:48,523
everybody go home, have some
pumpkin pie, warm apple cider.

1474
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:50,441
I got a better idea.

1475
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,946
Or would you rather me throw you
and your brother in the fucking river?

1476
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:58,116
Would you rather your house
blows up next time?

1477
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:04,580
I loved that car.
I know.

1478
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:11,003
What's he doing? Shakedown!

1479
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,840
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.

1480
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:15,004
Look at that shit.

1481
01:49:15,633 --> 01:49:16,968
Sorry, Frank.

1482
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:19,303
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.

1483
01:49:42,702 --> 01:49:45,163
All right, you call me back.

1484
01:49:46,456 --> 01:49:50,584
INS, IRS, FBI. I can't get a
damn thing out of any of them.

1485
01:49:50,585 --> 01:49:56,090
Because they all think you're on
the take. And you think they are.

1486
01:49:56,174 --> 01:49:59,093
You know, I don't think
they want this to stop.

1487
01:49:59,177 --> 01:50:01,596
I think it employs too many people.

1488
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:07,810
Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians,
prison guards, probation officers.

1489
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,520
They stop bringing dope
into this country,

1490
01:50:09,604 --> 01:50:12,356
about 100,000 people
are going to be out of a job.

1491
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:18,654
Spearman.

1492
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:22,116
FBI. Here to see Detective Roberts.

1493
01:50:26,704 --> 01:50:30,458
So who took it out? Somebody I know?
My wife?

1494
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:35,213
Come on, if somebody's taking a contract
out on my life, I'd like to know.

1495
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:38,883
I can't say without compromising
our source. You understand?

1496
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,385
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.

1497
01:50:41,469 --> 01:50:44,722
If you want we can assign someone to you.
FBI protection.

1498
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:49,060
You know what? My life
is dangerous enough as it is.

1499
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,188
Well, we'll let you get back
to your business.

1500
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:56,776
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting The Garden State.

1501
01:50:56,859 --> 01:50:57,944
Take care.

1502
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:00,404
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?

1503
01:51:00,488 --> 01:51:03,908
We know that you keep
calling about him.

1504
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:18,172
We believe that peace is at hand.

1505
01:51:20,174 --> 01:51:24,679
We believe that an agreement
is within sight.

1506
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:30,601
As I said earlier...

1507
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:36,148
Yeah.

1508
01:51:37,233 --> 01:51:39,235
Hey, Joey. Hi.

1509
01:51:41,153 --> 01:51:43,990
All right. Yeah, tomorrow. Why?

1510
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:03,948
What the fuck is a microwave?

1511
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:07,997
It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.

1512
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,957
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1513
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,126
It rearranges the molecules.

1514
01:52:12,209 --> 01:52:14,336
- Of what?
- Of what? Of popcorn.

1515
01:52:17,506 --> 01:52:20,301
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.

1516
01:52:23,595 --> 01:52:25,681
I can get you one of those.

1517
01:52:25,764 --> 01:52:29,101
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.

1518
01:52:29,476 --> 01:52:31,061
No, thank you.

1519
01:52:40,696 --> 01:52:42,740
Hey. Where is that?

1520
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:47,202
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time. You know who we met?

1521
01:52:47,286 --> 01:52:49,038
Who?

1522
01:52:49,121 --> 01:52:50,956
Burt Reynolds.

1523
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:54,793
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.

1524
01:52:54,877 --> 01:52:58,839
A lot people from Hollywood go up there
now. They're buying up everything.

1525
01:52:58,922 --> 01:53:00,591
This is your place?
Mmm.

1526
01:53:00,674 --> 01:53:04,553
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out. Five bedrooms.

1527
01:53:04,636 --> 01:53:07,765
Sauna. Everything. We were guests.

1528
01:53:12,478 --> 01:53:14,146
It's your place.

1529
01:53:29,244 --> 01:53:31,789
Isn't there something
we can do,

1530
01:53:33,624 --> 01:53:36,460
about leaving the big guy alone?

1531
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:38,504
You know who I mean.

1532
01:53:38,587 --> 01:53:42,174
I don't report what you just said,
I can get in a lot of trouble.

1533
01:53:42,257 --> 01:53:45,094
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.

1534
01:53:47,262 --> 01:53:49,598
I'm hoping you won't do that.

1535
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:52,976
Richie, come on. I'm not taping it.

1536
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:56,146
How do you know?
Because we're friends.

1537
01:53:56,230 --> 01:53:58,690
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.

1538
01:53:58,774 --> 01:54:00,692
From who? Your uncle?

1539
01:54:04,363 --> 01:54:06,907
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk our friendship?

1540
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:08,367
Because

1541
01:54:10,619 --> 01:54:12,955
I care what happens to you.

1542
01:54:14,998 --> 01:54:16,875
You shouldn't have done this.

1543
01:54:16,959 --> 01:54:20,170
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!

1544
01:54:20,879 --> 01:54:24,716
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.

1545
01:54:26,385 --> 01:54:27,845
Frank Lucas?

1546
01:54:29,054 --> 01:54:30,222
Yeah.

1547
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:35,769
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.

1548
01:54:36,562 --> 01:54:38,063
Tell her why.

1549
01:55:20,939 --> 01:55:22,441
Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1550
01:55:22,524 --> 01:55:24,860
Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?

1551
01:55:25,569 --> 01:55:27,821
You've been served.
I'm sorry.

1552
01:55:42,127 --> 01:55:43,170
WOMAN; All right.

1553
01:55:47,257 --> 01:55:48,467
Laurie.

1554
01:55:50,469 --> 01:55:54,223
Look, I'm sorry I never gave you
the kind of life you wanted, all right.

1555
01:55:54,306 --> 01:55:56,642
I'm sorry it was never enough.

1556
01:55:59,728 --> 01:56:02,397
Don't punish me for
being honest.

1557
01:56:02,481 --> 01:56:04,483
Don't take my boy away.

1558
01:56:06,818 --> 01:56:10,197
What are you saying?
That because you were honest

1559
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,492
and you didn't take money
like every other cop, I left you?

1560
01:56:13,575 --> 01:56:16,119
No, you don't take money
for one reason.

1561
01:56:16,203 --> 01:56:19,414
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.

1562
01:56:19,498 --> 01:56:21,542
And that's worse than taking money
nobody gives a shit about.

1563
01:56:21,625 --> 01:56:24,920
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.

1564
01:56:25,003 --> 01:56:28,507
You know, I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.

1565
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:31,301
Or don't take it. I don't care.
But then don't go cheat on me.

1566
01:56:31,385 --> 01:56:33,345
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.

1567
01:56:33,428 --> 01:56:37,641
Don't go out and get laid by your snitches
and your secretaries and strippers!

1568
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:40,561
I can tell byjust looking,
she's one of them.

1569
01:56:40,644 --> 01:56:41,728
You...

1570
01:56:41,812 --> 01:56:46,441
You think you're going to heaven
because you're honest, but you're not.

1571
01:56:46,525 --> 01:56:49,125
You're going to the same hell
as the crooked cops you can't stand.

1572
01:56:50,404 --> 01:56:51,989
All rise.

1573
01:56:56,368 --> 01:56:58,620
Please be seated.

1574
01:56:59,538 --> 01:57:03,917
Miss Dickerson, before the
court renders its opinion,

1575
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:06,712
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?

1576
01:57:06,795 --> 01:57:08,547
Yes, Your Honor.

1577
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:11,800
Your Honor, a lot has been said
here today about how unsavory

1578
01:57:11,883 --> 01:57:15,887
Mr. Roberts' environment is for a child.
How dangerous it is.

1579
01:57:15,971 --> 01:57:19,766
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that responsibility,

1580
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:22,436
but then say, "Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.

1581
01:57:22,519 --> 01:57:24,104
"We don't think
you're fit for that."

1582
01:57:24,187 --> 01:57:25,814
I'm not.

1583
01:57:26,565 --> 01:57:28,066
You're right.

1584
01:57:29,234 --> 01:57:31,695
Being around me is
no place for a kid.

1585
01:57:31,778 --> 01:57:35,032
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.

1586
01:57:37,951 --> 01:57:41,747
Your Honor, I want to apologize
for wasting the court's time.

1587
01:57:53,467 --> 01:57:55,177
Doc

1588
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,678
I see them.

1589
01:57:56,762 --> 01:57:58,305
There he is.

1590
01:58:16,782 --> 01:58:18,450
The fuck is this guy doing?

1591
01:58:19,201 --> 01:58:20,535
Hey!
Champagne.

1592
01:58:20,619 --> 01:58:22,829
Merry Christmas, Detectives.
For us?

1593
01:58:22,913 --> 01:58:24,790
Yeah. Enjoy that.

1594
01:58:25,123 --> 01:58:27,501
You fellas have a good time.
Mmm-hmm.

1595
01:58:28,627 --> 01:58:30,253
It's Cristal.

1596
01:58:34,257 --> 01:58:36,593
South Vietnamese troops
called in air strikes

1597
01:58:36,677 --> 01:58:39,638
on Communist positions
inside the city.

1598
01:58:41,098 --> 01:58:43,850
Paying off Johnny Law,
that's one thing.

1599
01:58:43,934 --> 01:58:44,935
There ain't no problem
with that.

1600
01:58:45,018 --> 01:58:48,105
I've been paying off the police
since I was 10 years old.

1601
01:58:48,188 --> 01:58:51,024
Put more of their kids through college
than the National Merit Award.

1602
01:58:51,108 --> 01:58:52,859
Give me one of them
round one... Yeah.

1603
01:58:52,943 --> 01:58:54,903
This is different, though. These...

1604
01:58:54,986 --> 01:58:58,949
Special Investigative Unit. That's their
problem. They think they're special.

1605
01:58:59,074 --> 01:59:01,702
Fucking crooks.
No code of ethics.

1606
01:59:01,785 --> 01:59:02,828
What do you think?

1607
01:59:02,911 --> 01:59:05,372
Looks great.
It's beautiful.

1608
01:59:05,455 --> 01:59:06,623
Good.

1609
01:59:07,207 --> 01:59:09,292
The police, that ain't the only
somebody I'm worried about.

1610
01:59:09,376 --> 01:59:12,379
I seeing cars where I ain't never seen
them before, people I don't know.

1611
01:59:12,462 --> 01:59:13,797
Yeah, me, too.

1612
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,507
Ho, ho, ho.

1613
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,778
Merry Christmas, Charlie.
Thank you.

1614
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:22,656
I love you.
I love you, too.

1615
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:25,993
Here, take this.

1616
01:59:26,285 --> 01:59:27,995
A quick toast,
and then I'll be off.

1617
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:33,125
What happened here was an
accident of war. Somebody made a mistake.

1618
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:36,257
Bumpy ain't hardly
ever go out no more.

1619
01:59:36,283 --> 01:59:38,781
After a certain point
he stayed in the house.

1620
01:59:41,467 --> 01:59:43,719
Watch TV.

1621
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:46,972
Play chess.
Read the newspaper.

1622
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:52,853
I thought he was just trying to lead the
quiet life, but no, he couldn't go nowhere.

1623
01:59:52,936 --> 01:59:56,148
Not without something happening.
Frankie...

1624
01:59:56,231 --> 01:59:59,693
We can still go out.
With who? Where?

1625
01:59:59,818 --> 02:00:03,197
Well, with...
But I know he's under surveillance.

1626
02:00:04,323 --> 02:00:07,910
Ain't gonna be no Christmas time
with my family being here no more.

1627
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:11,205
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?

1628
02:00:11,288 --> 02:00:15,626
I do pay them. I pay thousands and
millions to dope dealers, crooks, cops.

1629
02:00:16,043 --> 02:00:18,420
I pay everybody.
I pay more than they should get.

1630
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:20,672
I can't satisfy nobody!

1631
02:00:20,756 --> 02:00:25,052
It's like dope! Everybody's strung out!
The more you give 'em, the more they want.

1632
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:27,429
They expect more.

1633
02:00:28,472 --> 02:00:30,682
Give more and they want more.

1634
02:00:35,312 --> 02:00:37,439
Do you want to go out?

1635
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:40,359
All right, baby.
Put something of what you got.

1636
02:00:40,442 --> 02:00:41,693
Should I?
Yeah.

1637
02:00:41,777 --> 02:00:42,945
That's Christmas spirit.

1638
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:45,322
That's what I'm talking about.
Feliz Navidad.

1639
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:46,907
Something nice?
Mmm-hmm.

1640
02:00:54,665 --> 02:00:56,250
We're going to have a great time.

1641
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:57,417
That's right, chica.

1642
02:00:57,501 --> 02:01:00,087
Mr. Lucas. Enjoy your evening.

1643
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:02,673
It's all clear.

1644
02:01:06,385 --> 02:01:07,511
WOMAN;  Nicky!

1645
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:09,429
- Who is that?
- There's your boy, Nicky. See him?

1646
02:01:09,513 --> 02:01:10,594
Know what I'm saying?

1647
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:13,225
Yeah, I see him. Let's keep going.

1648
02:01:13,934 --> 02:01:15,018
Around back?

1649
02:01:15,102 --> 02:01:18,230
Hell, no.
I ain't sneaking into my own club.

1650
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:20,566
Incredible.
Huh?

1651
02:01:42,796 --> 02:01:44,047
Come on.

1652
02:01:47,092 --> 02:01:48,135
Hold on. Hold on.

1653
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:57,603
What?

1654
02:01:57,728 --> 02:01:59,521
I want to wait in the car.

1655
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:02,733
Frank, I got it. I got it.
I'll wait for it. I got it.

1656
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:05,110
Get that yellow sauce.
Yellow sauce.

1657
02:02:05,194 --> 02:02:07,279
And the chicken.
The Kung Pao chicken.

1658
02:02:13,452 --> 02:02:15,579
Can you turn the heater on?

1659
02:02:21,627 --> 02:02:23,962
Shit. I'm gonna go get the keys.

1660
02:02:37,768 --> 02:02:40,312
- Doc, give me the keys.
- Here you go.

1661
02:02:46,026 --> 02:02:47,319
Doc!

1662
02:02:51,448 --> 02:02:53,283
Get out of the car.

1663
02:02:59,665 --> 02:03:01,625
You okay?
Yeah.

1664
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:02,793
Shit.

1665
02:03:02,876 --> 02:03:04,002
Come on.

1666
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:06,171
Come on, baby.
You all right?

1667
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:08,465
Let's go.

1668
02:03:28,986 --> 02:03:30,737
Was it Nicky?

1669
02:03:32,197 --> 02:03:34,533
We'll go right now and fucking kill him
whether it was him or not,

1670
02:03:34,658 --> 02:03:36,702
you say the word, Frankie.

1671
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,497
We got to do something, Frank.

1672
02:03:40,872 --> 02:03:41,957
We can't just sit here.

1673
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,542
We're leaving.

1674
02:03:46,586 --> 02:03:48,297
- All right, everybody get out.
- You all right, man?

1675
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:50,632
Go on home. it's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.

1676
02:03:50,716 --> 02:03:52,050
I'm all right.

1677
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:55,304
Go on. Go ahead.
Be with your kids.

1678
02:03:55,387 --> 02:03:56,722
Go ahead.

1679
02:04:08,692 --> 02:04:09,776
Where are we gonna go, huh?

1680
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:11,541
We're gonna go to Spain, somewhere?
China?

1681
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:15,115
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.

1682
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:18,702
Frank, we can go
anywhere we want.

1683
02:04:18,785 --> 02:04:20,425
No, we can't.
We can live anywhere, Frank.

1684
02:04:20,454 --> 02:04:22,497
Where? And do what?
Run? Hide?

1685
02:04:22,581 --> 02:04:25,542
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.

1686
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,461
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.

1687
02:04:27,586 --> 02:04:29,838
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.

1688
02:04:29,921 --> 02:04:33,258
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.

1689
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:35,886
My country.
I ain't going nowhere.

1690
02:04:36,428 --> 02:04:38,680
I ain't running from nobody!

1691
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,558
This is America.

1692
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:51,026
And you ain't going
nowhere, either!

1693
02:04:53,236 --> 02:04:54,404
Huh?

1694
02:04:56,615 --> 02:04:58,784
A ceasefire, internationally
supervised,

1695
02:04:58,867 --> 02:04:59,367
will begin at 7:00 p. m. this Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time.

1696
02:04:59,368 --> 02:05:03,705
Will begin at 7:00 p.m. this Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time.

1697
02:05:03,789 --> 02:05:06,041
I'll call you back.

1698
02:05:06,124 --> 02:05:08,627
Hey! What are you doing?

1699
02:05:10,545 --> 02:05:11,797
Richie.

1700
02:05:15,592 --> 02:05:16,718
Wow.

1701
02:05:18,970 --> 02:05:23,725
So, what I hear it was the Corsican mob
took a shot at Frank.

1702
02:05:23,809 --> 02:05:25,727
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,

1703
02:05:25,811 --> 02:05:29,064
the exporters that Frank
has put out of business.

1704
02:05:29,606 --> 02:05:31,775
Look, I can take care
of him in New York.

1705
02:05:31,858 --> 02:05:33,318
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time

1706
02:05:33,402 --> 02:05:34,903
he drives across the
bridge to Jersey,

1707
02:05:34,986 --> 02:05:37,781
someone's gonna take
another shot at him.

1708
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:41,576
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.

1709
02:05:41,660 --> 02:05:44,329
We need to step up our efforts.

1710
02:05:44,413 --> 02:05:47,124
Next time,
their aim could be better.

1711
02:05:47,666 --> 02:05:50,335
We need to keep this
cash cow alive.

1712
02:05:56,049 --> 02:05:58,301
What the fuck are you doing here?

1713
02:05:58,844 --> 02:06:00,178
Whoa!

1714
02:06:03,348 --> 02:06:05,892
Were you actually gonna arrest
Frank Lucas?

1715
02:06:05,976 --> 02:06:07,394
What's the matter with you?

1716
02:06:07,686 --> 02:06:09,938
What, you don't know?
No.

1717
02:06:10,564 --> 02:06:13,608
Everybody in New Jersey's crazy.

1718
02:06:13,692 --> 02:06:17,112
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.

1719
02:06:19,364 --> 02:06:21,366
Before you get on
that bridge again,

1720
02:06:21,491 --> 02:06:24,870
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.

1721
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:29,583
"I'm more enlightened
than some of my friends.

1722
02:06:29,666 --> 02:06:31,710
"I can guarantee you peace of mind."

1723
02:06:31,793 --> 02:06:34,087
That's what you told me, Dominic.

1724
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:37,966
"I can guarantee you peace of mind!"

1725
02:06:38,049 --> 02:06:40,135
I don't feel so peaceful!

1726
02:06:41,553 --> 02:06:42,721
Huh?

1727
02:06:45,015 --> 02:06:47,225
They tried to kill my wife!

1728
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:53,565
Who was that? Huh?

1729
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:57,861
Maybe it was one of your peoples.

1730
02:06:57,944 --> 02:07:00,155
I don't know yet. No.
You don't know?

1731
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:02,032
You don't know.

1732
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:06,244
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just put 500 guns

1733
02:07:06,328 --> 02:07:08,413
out there on the street
and just start shooting up some people,

1734
02:07:08,497 --> 02:07:09,498
just to make a point.

1735
02:07:09,581 --> 02:07:12,959
Frank, it was a junkie. It was a rival.
Some dumb-ass kid

1736
02:07:13,043 --> 02:07:16,755
trying to make a name for himself.
Somebody you forgot to pay off.

1737
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,841
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.

1738
02:07:19,925 --> 02:07:24,846
Could be someone you put out of business
from being so successful. Look at you.

1739
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:28,558
Success, it's got enemies, Frank.
Lots of enemies.

1740
02:07:30,227 --> 02:07:32,771
So your success took a shot at you.
What are you gonna do now?

1741
02:07:32,896 --> 02:07:36,608
How you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become unsuccessful?

1742
02:07:37,526 --> 02:07:40,695
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?

1743
02:07:40,779 --> 02:07:44,699
Or we can be unsuccessful, too,
you know, we can have friends.

1744
02:07:44,783 --> 02:07:46,952
That's the choice we make.

1745
02:07:48,453 --> 02:07:52,123
The final evacuation of
military and diplomatic personnel

1746
02:07:52,207 --> 02:07:53,667
continued throughout the night,

1747
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:56,795
as North Vietnamese troops
marched on Saigon.

1748
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:02,050
The imminent fall of the city has brought
chaos and a growing sense of desperation.

1749
02:08:11,059 --> 02:08:14,479
Operator.
Yeah, Bangkok, 367, international.

1750
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:15,981
One moment, please.

1751
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:25,907
Yeah, Nate.

1752
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:27,659
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?

1753
02:08:27,784 --> 02:08:29,160
What's going on over there?

1754
02:08:29,244 --> 02:08:30,495
It's all over.

1755
02:08:30,579 --> 02:08:32,414
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?

1756
02:08:32,497 --> 02:08:34,249
The game's over, Frank.

1757
02:08:34,332 --> 02:08:35,667
Huh?
It's done.

1758
02:08:35,792 --> 02:08:37,752
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.

1759
02:08:37,836 --> 02:08:39,276
Well, look, I'm not... Listen to me.

1760
02:08:39,337 --> 02:08:40,922
I want two...

1761
02:08:42,007 --> 02:08:44,718
I want 2,000 keys in the air.

1762
02:08:44,801 --> 02:08:48,096
It's impossible, Frank. All our
resources are going home. It's over.

1763
02:08:48,179 --> 02:08:49,973
I'll tell you what.
I'm on my way over there.

1764
02:08:50,056 --> 02:08:52,017
Right now? Oh, come...
Yeah.

1765
02:08:59,357 --> 02:09:01,526
You stole my shit?

1766
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:03,778
Spearman, wake the fuck up, man.
What?

1767
02:09:05,697 --> 02:09:07,282
Where's my shit, Darlynn?

1768
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:09,326
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!

1769
02:09:10,952 --> 02:09:12,829
- Jesus! What the... Police!
- Police!

1770
02:09:12,912 --> 02:09:14,912
- Drop the gun, Jimmy!
- Drop the gun!

1771
02:09:14,956 --> 02:09:17,083
- Let me see your hands!
- Jimmy, drop the fucking gun!

1772
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:19,961
I'm not playing with you, Jimmy!
I'll blast your fucking head off!

1773
02:09:20,045 --> 02:09:22,047
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1774
02:09:23,548 --> 02:09:26,718
I got your gun and
I got your prints.

1775
02:09:27,927 --> 02:09:32,182
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.

1776
02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:34,601
Fifteen fucking years!

1777
02:09:34,684 --> 02:09:38,063
Attempted murder is the same as
Murder One, that's a grand jury.

1778
02:09:38,146 --> 02:09:40,398
Now, a grand jury could
come back favorably.

1779
02:09:40,523 --> 02:09:43,652
It could be reduced
to manslaughter.

1780
02:09:43,735 --> 02:09:45,904
All right?
Maybe even self-defense.

1781
02:09:46,029 --> 02:09:47,989
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.

1782
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:49,991
See where this is
fucking going, Jimmy?

1783
02:09:50,075 --> 02:09:51,242
Let's say you beat it.

1784
02:09:51,326 --> 02:09:53,578
What you think your cousin
Frank is gonna think?

1785
02:09:53,662 --> 02:09:55,997
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,

1786
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,625
we sat you down, and we
talked to you like this.

1787
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:01,419
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?

1788
02:10:01,503 --> 02:10:05,006
What's he gonna think? Is he stupid?
Ls your cousin Frank stupid?

1789
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:07,008
Answer him!

1790
02:10:07,092 --> 02:10:09,886
No. He's going to
assume that you talked.

1791
02:10:12,931 --> 02:10:15,350
But right now,
Frank doesn't know.

1792
02:10:15,433 --> 02:10:17,852
You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?

1793
02:10:17,936 --> 02:10:19,938
Or do you just want
to walk out of here?

1794
02:10:20,063 --> 02:10:23,733
No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today.

1795
02:10:24,776 --> 02:10:26,277
Your choice.

1796
02:10:36,121 --> 02:10:40,625
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.

1797
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:46,047
They'll still be here
long after the troops have gone.

1798
02:10:47,382 --> 02:10:52,053
What are you going to do for transportation
when the last US plane goes home?

1799
02:10:52,512 --> 02:10:54,556
I'll figure something out.

1800
02:10:56,057 --> 02:10:58,810
You will see me again,
that's for sure.

1801
02:11:00,103 --> 02:11:03,273
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,

1802
02:11:03,606 --> 02:11:06,609
but quitting while you're ahead

1803
02:11:07,235 --> 02:11:09,446
is not the same as quitting.

1804
02:11:51,196 --> 02:11:52,655
Yeah.
Hey.

1805
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:53,740
Go get him.

1806
02:11:56,701 --> 02:11:58,995
Whatever you want to do, baby.
One second.

1807
02:11:59,078 --> 02:12:00,789
It's Frank.
Yeah.

1808
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:04,375
Yeah.

1809
02:12:04,459 --> 02:12:05,835
Newark.

1810
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:08,338
Short term,

1811
02:12:09,047 --> 02:12:11,299
parking lot three.

1812
02:12:11,382 --> 02:12:13,134
Short term, lot three.

1813
02:12:13,218 --> 02:12:16,513
That's the Mustang we talking about, right?
Okay, right. What's the plate number?

1814
02:12:16,596 --> 02:12:19,057
K-A...
K-A...

1815
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:21,392
- ... 760.
- ... 76.

1816
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:23,144
Zero. All right.

1817
02:12:24,437 --> 02:12:26,481
There's no short term
lot three at Newark.

1818
02:12:26,564 --> 02:12:28,817
They got letters. A-B-C-D.
I know.

1819
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:31,069
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?

1820
02:12:31,319 --> 02:12:36,199
This isn't no Jersey license
plate, nor New York, for that matter.

1821
02:12:36,282 --> 02:12:39,077
K-A-7-6-0?
Yep.

1822
02:12:40,245 --> 02:12:41,913
Kilo Alpha?

1823
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:43,957
A plane tail number?

1824
02:12:44,332 --> 02:12:46,417
Kilo Alpha 760.

1825
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:50,296
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.

1826
02:12:50,421 --> 02:12:53,049
Everything, from a little fucking Cessna
to the biggest fucking whatever jet.

1827
02:12:53,132 --> 02:12:54,259
All right?

1828
02:12:54,342 --> 02:12:55,844
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?

1829
02:12:55,927 --> 02:12:58,805
You're not going anywhere.
Sit... Sit down.

1830
02:13:21,494 --> 02:13:22,954
Captain?
Yeah?

1831
02:13:23,037 --> 02:13:27,000
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.

1832
02:13:27,125 --> 02:13:29,961
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.

1833
02:13:30,044 --> 02:13:31,129
Wait! Wait!

1834
02:13:31,254 --> 02:13:34,674
Scotty, stop all these soldiers!
Check their bags. Every one of them.

1835
02:13:45,143 --> 02:13:47,020
No-knock warrant.

1836
02:13:47,562 --> 02:13:50,148
All right. Start upstairs.
Where are they going?

1837
02:13:50,231 --> 02:13:51,858
Step in, sweetie.

1838
02:13:52,191 --> 02:13:53,818
Ma'am, please sit down.

1839
02:13:53,902 --> 02:13:55,361
What is this?

1840
02:13:55,862 --> 02:13:59,324
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
All this stops! Hey. Hey. Hey.

1841
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:02,785
Nothing leaves this area, all right?
Just slow down with this.

1842
02:14:02,869 --> 02:14:04,909
- All right. Stop these trucks.
- Hold on, hold on.

1843
02:14:04,954 --> 02:14:06,915
Everything off the walls!
Just pull it all down.

1844
02:14:06,998 --> 02:14:08,207
Damn thing's a monster, Rich.

1845
02:14:08,291 --> 02:14:09,292
What is this?

1846
02:14:09,375 --> 02:14:10,668
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.

1847
02:14:10,752 --> 02:14:12,086
All right, Captain. Nothing.

1848
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:14,255
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.

1849
02:14:14,339 --> 02:14:15,590
Every man here gets searched.

1850
02:14:15,673 --> 02:14:17,550
Read the warrant, sir.

1851
02:14:18,217 --> 02:14:21,054
Your husband's illustrious
career is over.

1852
02:14:21,512 --> 02:14:24,766
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.

1853
02:14:25,099 --> 02:14:29,395
And then they're gonna take it all.
But not before I get my gratuity.

1854
02:14:30,188 --> 02:14:31,439
So where's the money?

1855
02:14:31,522 --> 02:14:33,066
What are you talking about?
What money?

1856
02:14:33,149 --> 02:14:34,776
What am I talking about? What money?

1857
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:39,030
The getaway money that Frank and
every other gangster keeps in his house.

1858
02:14:39,113 --> 02:14:42,909
If you leave now, there's a
chance Frank might not kill you.

1859
02:14:44,202 --> 02:14:45,787
Shut up! Sit down!

1860
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:47,205
Sit down!

1861
02:15:27,912 --> 02:15:30,248
Defense today
announced the planned evacuation

1862
02:15:30,331 --> 02:15:33,376
of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,

1863
02:15:33,459 --> 02:15:36,212
news that comes too late for some,

1864
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:39,966
as here, on a solemn tarmac
at Dover Air Force Base.

1865
02:15:40,091 --> 02:15:43,594
This C-130,
loaded down with its sorrowful cargo,

1866
02:15:43,678 --> 02:15:47,932
a cargo of America's bravest and best,
en route to their final resting places.

1867
02:16:03,573 --> 02:16:05,199
You guys. Take this coffin down.

1868
02:16:13,583 --> 02:16:15,251
Open it.
I'm not doing that.

1869
02:16:22,008 --> 02:16:23,968
Great fucking dog, huh?

1870
02:16:31,976 --> 02:16:33,895
You stop this, right now.

1871
02:16:33,978 --> 02:16:37,356
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,

1872
02:16:38,316 --> 02:16:40,068
the plane and its cargo.

1873
02:16:40,151 --> 02:16:42,653
Well, you don't have my permission.

1874
02:16:43,362 --> 02:16:44,739
I don't need it, Captain.

1875
02:16:46,324 --> 02:16:50,119
Easy! Easy, boy.
Come on. Hey! Easy!

1876
02:16:50,203 --> 02:16:52,413
Frank, move out of the way.

1877
02:16:58,836 --> 02:17:00,171
Damn.

1878
02:17:05,009 --> 02:17:06,511
That's enough!

1879
02:17:14,018 --> 02:17:16,020
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them out of your sight.

1880
02:17:16,104 --> 02:17:17,688
Got it. Okay.

1881
02:17:19,023 --> 02:17:21,192
Hey.
Help me outwith this.

1882
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,261
That was a military
transport plane.

1883
02:17:48,386 --> 02:17:49,554
If there was heroin on board,

1884
02:17:49,637 --> 02:17:51,472
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.

1885
02:17:51,556 --> 02:17:56,018
Which means that even as it fights a war
that's claimed 50,000 American lives,

1886
02:17:56,102 --> 02:17:58,479
the military is
smuggling narcotics.

1887
02:17:58,563 --> 02:18:01,232
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.

1888
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:02,984
That someone employed
by this office

1889
02:18:03,067 --> 02:18:06,654
believes that the United States Army
is in the drug trafficking business

1890
02:18:06,737 --> 02:18:10,116
and is trying to prove it by
desecrating the remains of young men

1891
02:18:10,199 --> 02:18:13,119
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!

1892
02:18:13,202 --> 02:18:15,746
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!

1893
02:18:17,248 --> 02:18:20,626
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,

1894
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,920
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy

1895
02:18:23,004 --> 02:18:26,007
of being dismantled as completely
and enthusiastically

1896
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:27,925
as that fucking transport plane?

1897
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:30,511
That is what you've accomplished,
Mr. Roberts, single-handedly.

1898
02:18:30,595 --> 02:18:32,680
I had good information.

1899
02:18:32,763 --> 02:18:36,309
That the target of my investigation
was bringing dope in on that plane.

1900
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:38,311
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.

1901
02:18:38,394 --> 02:18:40,521
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.

1902
02:18:40,605 --> 02:18:43,191
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for? Which family?

1903
02:18:43,274 --> 02:18:45,359
He's not Italian.
He's black.

1904
02:18:48,654 --> 02:18:51,532
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?

1905
02:18:51,616 --> 02:18:53,868
You're this close to the end of
your career in law enforcement

1906
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:56,579
and you're making
fucking jokes?

1907
02:18:56,662 --> 02:18:58,998
My investigation indicates

1908
02:18:59,123 --> 02:19:02,543
that Frank Lucas is above the
Mafia in the dope business.

1909
02:19:02,627 --> 02:19:04,170
My investigations also indicate

1910
02:19:04,253 --> 02:19:08,424
that Frank Lucas buys direct
from a source in Southeast Asia.

1911
02:19:08,507 --> 02:19:11,677
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes

1912
02:19:11,802 --> 02:19:15,640
and personnel to transport pure number
4 heroin into the United States

1913
02:19:15,723 --> 02:19:19,810
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.

1914
02:19:19,894 --> 02:19:22,813
I have cases against
every member of Frank's organization.

1915
02:19:22,897 --> 02:19:24,023
Frank's organization?

1916
02:19:24,148 --> 02:19:27,902
No fucking nigger has ever accomplished what
the American Mafia hasn't in 100 years!

1917
02:19:27,985 --> 02:19:29,265
And you would know that how?
Why?

1918
02:19:29,278 --> 02:19:30,947
'Cause your head is stuck up
your fucking ass?

1919
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:33,407
Hey, Lou, do me a favor. Will you
get this fucking kike out of here?

1920
02:19:33,491 --> 02:19:34,992
Kike? Kike?

1921
02:19:35,076 --> 02:19:36,244
Richie, no.

1922
02:19:39,872 --> 02:19:41,415
Hey, Richie!

1923
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:43,751
Make it stick.

1924
02:19:44,168 --> 02:19:46,837
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a quarter mile away.

1925
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:19,370
Doctor.

1926
02:20:21,163 --> 02:20:22,331
What?

1927
02:20:22,707 --> 02:20:25,793
Fucking Trupo came by
the house, man. It's bad.

1928
02:20:40,599 --> 02:20:43,978
Frankie, I need to speak with
you a minute. Please?

1929
02:20:44,061 --> 02:20:46,647
I got to go, Ma.
No, sit down just a minute.

1930
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:48,941
Would you please come
back a little later?

1931
02:20:49,025 --> 02:20:50,067
Thank you.

1932
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:52,611
Ma, I got to go. All right?
Just a few words.

1933
02:20:52,695 --> 02:20:54,155
Listen to me. I got...

1934
02:20:54,238 --> 02:20:56,532
Please, sit down. Just a few words.

1935
02:20:56,615 --> 02:20:58,242
I've been thinking
about some things.

1936
02:20:58,326 --> 02:21:01,996
You know, if you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would have been preachers.

1937
02:21:02,079 --> 02:21:03,039
Right.

1938
02:21:03,122 --> 02:21:07,084
If you'd been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers. You know that.

1939
02:21:07,168 --> 02:21:10,838
They came here because of you.
You called and they came running.

1940
02:21:10,921 --> 02:21:12,006
Right.

1941
02:21:12,089 --> 02:21:15,509
That's because they look up to you.

1942
02:21:15,593 --> 02:21:19,930
They always expect you
to know what's best.

1943
02:21:20,181 --> 02:21:22,350
But even they know

1944
02:21:22,433 --> 02:21:24,268
you don't shoot cops.

1945
02:21:26,395 --> 02:21:28,064
Even I know that.

1946
02:21:29,273 --> 02:21:30,608
Eva knows it.
All right, Ma.

1947
02:21:30,691 --> 02:21:33,235
The only one who doesn't
seem to know is you!

1948
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:36,655
All right, Ma. I got to go. I promise
you, I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1949
02:21:36,739 --> 02:21:40,368
I never asked you where all this came from
because I didn't want to hear you lie.

1950
02:21:40,451 --> 02:21:42,536
I didn't want you to worry about it.
Now, come on, I got to go.

1951
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,246
Don't lie to me!

1952
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:50,336
Don't do that.

1953
02:21:51,712 --> 02:21:55,132
Do you want to make things so bad

1954
02:21:55,216 --> 02:21:58,052
for your family that they'll leave you?
Because they will.

1955
02:21:58,135 --> 02:21:59,220
I understand.

1956
02:21:59,303 --> 02:22:01,639
She will leave you.

1957
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:03,307
All right, Mama.

1958
02:22:05,768 --> 02:22:07,436
I will leave you!

1959
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:36,507
Got coffins
on the move, Richie.

1960
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:40,052
We want the transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.

1961
02:22:41,262 --> 02:22:42,972
Who are these guys?

1962
02:22:44,974 --> 02:22:46,600
What does it say?

1963
02:22:49,353 --> 02:22:51,939
Bayonne Custodial Services?

1964
02:22:52,022 --> 02:22:53,691
Bayonne Cleaning Services?

1965
02:22:53,774 --> 02:22:54,942
Bayonne?
What the fuck is that?

1966
02:22:55,025 --> 02:22:56,944
Give me the camera, Al.

1967
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:00,698
Bingo.

1968
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:03,576
Holy shit.
That's the baseball kid.

1969
02:23:03,701 --> 02:23:05,703
Oh, yeah. That's Stevie Lucas.

1970
02:23:05,786 --> 02:23:08,414
So what you want to do, Richie?
Follow the trucks?

1971
02:23:08,497 --> 02:23:11,625
No. No.
I wanna stay here with the Lucas kid.

1972
02:23:11,709 --> 02:23:13,377
We'll follow that van.

1973
02:23:13,461 --> 02:23:16,881
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.

1974
02:23:27,641 --> 02:23:31,645
Come on, more precious than gold,
man. This is more precious than gold.

1975
02:23:31,729 --> 02:23:34,732
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.

1976
02:23:35,232 --> 02:23:37,193
Take it. Take it.

1977
02:23:37,276 --> 02:23:39,737
Give me a second, man,
give me a second.

1978
02:23:40,905 --> 02:23:44,450
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets left, man.
Let's make some fucking money in here.

1979
02:23:47,077 --> 02:23:48,245
What are they loading in there?

1980
02:23:48,329 --> 02:23:49,538
What the fuck
are they loading in there?

1981
02:23:49,622 --> 02:23:50,748
That's the dope.

1982
02:23:50,831 --> 02:23:53,834
That's got to be the dope!
It's got to be.

1983
02:23:54,418 --> 02:23:55,753
Let's go.

1984
02:23:56,587 --> 02:23:58,088
Let's move.

1985
02:24:50,724 --> 02:24:52,101
Lou, it's Richie.

1986
02:24:52,184 --> 02:24:54,770
We got everybody in place.
Everybody.

1987
02:24:54,853 --> 02:24:56,093
Are you sure this is it?

1988
02:24:56,105 --> 02:24:57,982
I'm positive, man. Okay?

1989
02:24:58,065 --> 02:24:59,733
All right, they're
cutting and bagging

1990
02:24:59,817 --> 02:25:02,695
in the South Tower of the
Stephen Crane Projects right now.

1991
02:25:02,778 --> 02:25:04,947
Are you sure this is it?
You're positive?

1992
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:07,908
I'm positive, Lou.
I'm positive. Okay?

1993
02:25:07,992 --> 02:25:10,411
Everything is ready to go.
All the guys are ready to go.

1994
02:25:10,494 --> 02:25:12,913
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?

1995
02:25:12,997 --> 02:25:14,623
Okay. You got it.

1996
02:25:22,172 --> 02:25:23,674
You all right?

1997
02:26:16,101 --> 02:26:18,228
Got the warrant.
All right.

1998
02:26:21,774 --> 02:26:23,400
Let's go!

1999
02:26:40,167 --> 02:26:41,418
Move!

2000
02:26:44,463 --> 02:26:46,924
Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
What's going on here?

2001
02:26:47,925 --> 02:26:49,927
Get down!
Get down, motherfucker!

2002
02:26:50,969 --> 02:26:53,722
Go.
Okay. Let's go, Al!

2003
02:26:53,931 --> 02:26:55,766
Move it, come on.

2004
02:26:56,684 --> 02:26:58,727
Come on, move it.
Move it!

2005
02:27:40,978 --> 02:27:42,146
All set.

2006
02:27:42,855 --> 02:27:44,064
Roger.

2007
02:27:45,649 --> 02:27:46,734
Get ready.

2008
02:27:46,942 --> 02:27:48,902
- There you go!
- All right.

2009
02:27:50,863 --> 02:27:51,905
Come on.

2010
02:27:59,997 --> 02:28:01,331
At target.

2011
02:28:02,082 --> 02:28:04,209
Spearman, stand by.

2012
02:28:04,293 --> 02:28:06,712
I got civilians on
the target floor.

2013
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:11,175
What? Oh...

2014
02:28:11,633 --> 02:28:13,218
Come on, there you go.

2015
02:28:13,302 --> 02:28:14,887
Hey, Tim.

2016
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:17,139
Girl, why don't you get
some clothes on?

2017
02:28:21,685 --> 02:28:22,936
Let's go.

2018
02:28:29,526 --> 02:28:31,153
You think you bad, huh?

2019
02:28:35,532 --> 02:28:38,202
Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?

2020
02:28:38,285 --> 02:28:39,536
Come on!

2021
02:28:41,497 --> 02:28:42,873
I'll get it!

2022
02:28:45,042 --> 02:28:46,585
Where's Tim?

2023
02:28:47,544 --> 02:28:49,004
Quiet, kid!

2024
02:28:55,552 --> 02:28:58,388
I got some sandwiches
for you boys, man.

2025
02:29:00,224 --> 02:29:01,892
But where's Tim?

2026
02:29:01,975 --> 02:29:04,561
Shit. Man,
Tim always playing around.

2027
02:29:05,896 --> 02:29:07,231
Hey, man!

2028
02:29:07,523 --> 02:29:09,483
You got some Blue Magic, baby?

2029
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:12,402
Fucking junkie!

2030
02:29:13,195 --> 02:29:14,655
Yo, handle that!

2031
02:29:14,738 --> 02:29:16,240
I'm sick!
Come on! I got money, man!

2032
02:29:16,323 --> 02:29:18,242
Come on, man,
you know me, baby!

2033
02:29:18,325 --> 02:29:21,119
Come on!
Come on, I need that Blue Magic, man.

2034
02:29:21,203 --> 02:29:22,663
It's me, Boogaloo, baby.

2035
02:29:22,746 --> 02:29:25,833
Hey, man, you know I got
your god damn money. Come on, man.

2036
02:29:25,916 --> 02:29:28,168
- And one, two, three!
- Fucking junkie.

2037
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:31,839
Police! Police!

2038
02:29:31,922 --> 02:29:33,674
- Drop it!
- Get out, get out!

2039
02:29:33,757 --> 02:29:34,925
Drop the gun!
Don't do it!

2040
02:29:35,008 --> 02:29:37,010
Drop the gun, drop it!
Don't do it.

2041
02:29:39,221 --> 02:29:40,597
Scotty!

2042
02:29:43,892 --> 02:29:45,435
Police! Everybody down!

2043
02:29:47,896 --> 02:29:49,106
You motherfucker!

2044
02:29:52,192 --> 02:29:54,278
Police! Nobody move!
Look out!

2045
02:30:02,411 --> 02:30:04,288
Don't fucking move!

2046
02:30:14,256 --> 02:30:16,800
I want to see your hands!
All the hands!

2047
02:30:16,925 --> 02:30:17,968
Police!

2048
02:30:21,555 --> 02:30:23,724
Down! Down! Get down!

2049
02:30:23,807 --> 02:30:25,601
Stay the fuck down!

2050
02:31:17,319 --> 02:31:19,655
Hey, man, what's going on?

2051
02:31:24,868 --> 02:31:26,370
What the hell...

2052
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:41,218
Stay down!
Down, motherfucker! Stay down!

2053
02:31:41,301 --> 02:31:42,886
Hands! Hands!

2054
02:31:47,724 --> 02:31:49,518
Out at home, baby.

2055
02:32:00,696 --> 02:32:03,031
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

2056
02:32:03,198 --> 02:32:05,742
Y'all wait right here.
Wait right here.

2057
02:32:30,308 --> 02:32:32,936
Mrs. Lucas, please step back inside.
Yes, Officer.

2058
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:34,354
Please, Mother Lucas,
step inside, please.

2059
02:32:34,438 --> 02:32:37,858
Respectfully, ma'am, please step inside.
Thank you. Step inside.

2060
02:32:49,119 --> 02:32:51,580
Hands up against the wall.
Stay back.

2061
02:32:53,915 --> 02:32:55,292
Oh, man.

2062
02:32:55,375 --> 02:32:58,128
Don't you owe me money?
I'll get you some more. Here you go.

2063
02:32:59,921 --> 02:33:02,049
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!

2064
02:33:02,132 --> 02:33:04,217
NYPD! Everybody stand still!

2065
02:33:07,262 --> 02:33:08,805
Turner! Go!

2066
02:33:10,307 --> 02:33:12,434
Down on the ground,
motherfucker!

2067
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:51,181
dead servicemen returning from
defending our country in Vietnam...

2068
02:33:53,683 --> 02:33:56,645
Over there. Okay.

2069
02:34:02,192 --> 02:34:05,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this stage of the proceedings

2070
02:34:05,237 --> 02:34:08,573
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.

2071
02:34:08,657 --> 02:34:11,743
For the prosecution,
Mr. Roberts will proceed

2072
02:34:11,827 --> 02:34:14,162
with his opening statement first.

2073
02:34:14,579 --> 02:34:18,500
Mr. Roberts,
are you ready to proceed?

2074
02:34:20,210 --> 02:34:21,878
Yes, Your Honor.

2075
02:34:25,757 --> 02:34:28,385
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2076
02:34:32,722 --> 02:34:36,643
the State will show
and you will hear

2077
02:34:36,726 --> 02:34:40,564
that Frank Lucas is the
most dangerous man

2078
02:34:40,647 --> 02:34:42,983
walking the streets of our city.

2079
02:34:45,694 --> 02:34:49,614
All right, y'all, get on out.
Let me talk to Mr. Richie alone.

2080
02:34:52,701 --> 02:34:56,955
Come on, come on, come on. I pay
y'all by the hour, not by the minute.

2081
02:34:58,915 --> 02:35:00,250
Thank you.

2082
02:35:05,046 --> 02:35:07,465
You ain't wearing a wire,
are you?

2083
02:35:08,091 --> 02:35:09,426
No.

2084
02:35:10,177 --> 02:35:13,096
All right.
I was talking to my lawyers.

2085
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:16,183
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.

2086
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:20,312
Did you really find a million
dollars in the trunk of a car

2087
02:35:20,437 --> 02:35:22,147
and then turn it in? Did you do that?
Yeah.

2088
02:35:22,272 --> 02:35:23,648
You did that for real, huh?

2089
02:35:23,773 --> 02:35:27,152
My man. Good for you. Shit.

2090
02:35:27,235 --> 02:35:29,321
You know Johnny Law
got it though, right?

2091
02:35:29,404 --> 02:35:31,406
Maybe.
Ain't no maybe about it, Mr. Richie.

2092
02:35:31,489 --> 02:35:33,742
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,

2093
02:35:33,825 --> 02:35:36,536
he took it and you ain't get
nothing for it. Did you?

2094
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:38,371
Why did you do that?

2095
02:35:38,455 --> 02:35:41,291
It was the right thing to do.
That's true.

2096
02:35:41,374 --> 02:35:43,084
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.

2097
02:35:43,168 --> 02:35:45,378
The question I have, the question
I've been asking myself is,

2098
02:35:45,462 --> 02:35:47,339
would you do it again?

2099
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:51,593
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.

2100
02:35:51,676 --> 02:35:55,263
Many car payments ago,
many child support payments ago.

2101
02:35:56,973 --> 02:36:00,852
So I said to myself, the onlyest
way to find out is to find out.

2102
02:36:02,354 --> 02:36:08,151
Bribery, extortion, murder,
racketeering...

2103
02:36:10,195 --> 02:36:11,905
Now,
you give me an address,

2104
02:36:11,988 --> 02:36:15,450
I'll make sure the car's there, I'll
make sure that money's in that trunk.

2105
02:36:15,533 --> 02:36:17,035
No, thanks.

2106
02:36:17,118 --> 02:36:18,495
You sure?

2107
02:36:20,330 --> 02:36:23,250
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think, that impresses me?

2108
02:36:23,333 --> 02:36:26,086
You think that you're better than them?
You ain't no better than them other cops.

2109
02:36:26,169 --> 02:36:29,547
In fact, you're the same as them.
You are them.

2110
02:36:29,631 --> 02:36:30,757
Let me ask you this.

2111
02:36:30,840 --> 02:36:34,094
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars

2112
02:36:34,177 --> 02:36:35,971
is going to change anything
on them streets?

2113
02:36:36,054 --> 02:36:37,597
Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it,

2114
02:36:37,681 --> 02:36:39,933
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.

2115
02:36:40,016 --> 02:36:43,144
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.

2116
02:36:43,228 --> 02:36:44,437
Then that's the way it is.

2117
02:36:44,521 --> 02:36:46,606
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?

2118
02:36:46,690 --> 02:36:48,984
We got me and you sitting here.

2119
02:36:49,067 --> 02:36:51,569
We got that little snitch-ass driver
for my brother.

2120
02:36:51,653 --> 02:36:53,571
You got a little bit of powder.

2121
02:36:53,655 --> 02:36:55,448
You're going to need
more than that, Richie.

2122
02:36:55,532 --> 02:36:59,077
I got possession, supply,
conspiracy,

2123
02:36:59,244 --> 02:37:03,373
bribing a law officer. I got people who'll
attest to seeing you kill in cold blood.

2124
02:37:03,498 --> 02:37:07,419
I got your offshore bank accounts,
your real estate, your businesses,

2125
02:37:07,544 --> 02:37:10,463
all bought with money from heroin.

2126
02:37:10,547 --> 02:37:13,425
And I got hundreds of
parents of dead kids.

2127
02:37:13,508 --> 02:37:16,011
Addicts who OD'ed on your product.
And that's my story for the jury.

2128
02:37:16,094 --> 02:37:19,806
And that's how I make it all stick.
"This man murdered thousands of people.

2129
02:37:19,889 --> 02:37:21,808
"And he did it from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."

2130
02:37:21,891 --> 02:37:23,685
Aside from that,
you got nothing to worry about.

2131
02:37:23,768 --> 02:37:26,646
That's pretty good. But that's why
we go to court, isn't it, Richie?

2132
02:37:26,730 --> 02:37:28,315
'Cause I got witnesses, too.

2133
02:37:28,398 --> 02:37:32,402
I got celebrities. I got sports
figures. I got Harlem, Richie.

2134
02:37:32,902 --> 02:37:36,740
I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's gonna
take care of me. You can believe that.

2135
02:37:36,865 --> 02:37:39,326
I got more than that, Frank.
What you got?

2136
02:37:39,409 --> 02:37:42,120
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify against you,

2137
02:37:42,245 --> 02:37:44,581
it stretches out the door
and around the block.

2138
02:37:44,706 --> 02:37:48,501
You damaged a lot of lives, Frank.
I got the Mazzano crime family.

2139
02:37:48,585 --> 02:37:50,211
Remember those boys?
You put them out of business.

2140
02:37:50,295 --> 02:37:51,713
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.

2141
02:37:51,796 --> 02:37:53,048
Mazzanos ain't got
nothing to do with me.

2142
02:37:53,131 --> 02:37:54,549
They got everything to do with you.
What, they...

2143
02:37:54,632 --> 02:37:55,800
You know why?
Why?

2144
02:37:55,884 --> 02:37:58,887
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,

2145
02:37:58,970 --> 02:38:00,221
they hate what you represent.

2146
02:38:00,305 --> 02:38:03,892
I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas.
You sure?

2147
02:38:03,975 --> 02:38:06,061
A black businessman like you?

2148
02:38:06,144 --> 02:38:08,355
You represent progress.

2149
02:38:08,438 --> 02:38:11,900
The kind of progress that's going
to see them lose a lot of money.

2150
02:38:11,983 --> 02:38:15,612
With you out of the way,
everything can return to normal.

2151
02:38:16,696 --> 02:38:17,947
My man.

2152
02:38:22,786 --> 02:38:25,121
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?

2153
02:38:25,205 --> 02:38:28,291
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.

2154
02:38:29,626 --> 02:38:32,253
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house

2155
02:38:32,337 --> 02:38:35,298
dragging my little 12-year-old
cousin out, tying him to a pole,

2156
02:38:35,382 --> 02:38:38,551
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.

2157
02:38:38,635 --> 02:38:41,930
Then they bust two shotgun shells in his
head and knock his fucking head off.

2158
02:38:42,013 --> 02:38:43,264
That's what normal is to me.

2159
02:38:43,348 --> 02:38:46,434
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.

2160
02:38:46,518 --> 02:38:49,521
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.

2161
02:38:49,854 --> 02:38:52,148
You know what,
you can do whatever you want to do.

2162
02:38:52,232 --> 02:38:54,734
So, it don't mean nothing to me
for you to show up tomorrow morning

2163
02:38:54,818 --> 02:38:57,737
with your head blown off.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

2164
02:38:57,821 --> 02:39:03,243
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches around the block, too.

2165
02:39:06,663 --> 02:39:07,997
All right.

2166
02:39:11,793 --> 02:39:13,253
What do you want to do?

2167
02:39:19,801 --> 02:39:21,469
You know what you got to do.

2168
02:39:21,553 --> 02:39:23,346
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?

2169
02:39:23,430 --> 02:39:24,931
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.

2170
02:39:25,014 --> 02:39:27,100
What do you want?
You want gangsters?

2171
02:39:27,183 --> 02:39:30,979
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?

2172
02:39:31,438 --> 02:39:34,190
They've been bleeding Harlem dry
since they got off the boat, Richie.

2173
02:39:34,274 --> 02:39:38,111
I don't give a fuck about no crime
figures. You can have them.

2174
02:39:39,195 --> 02:39:40,780
I'll take them, too.

2175
02:39:40,864 --> 02:39:42,782
You'll take them, too?

2176
02:39:47,912 --> 02:39:51,624
No, you didn't. You're talking
about police. You want police?

2177
02:39:52,208 --> 02:39:53,251
You want your own kind?

2178
02:39:53,334 --> 02:39:55,295
They're not my kind.

2179
02:39:55,378 --> 02:39:58,089
They're in business with you, Frank.
They ain't my kind.

2180
02:39:58,173 --> 02:40:02,093
They ain't my kind like the
Italians are not yours. All right?

2181
02:40:05,346 --> 02:40:06,389
Huh.

2182
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:18,109
What can you promise me, Richie?

2183
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:24,532
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,

2184
02:40:24,616 --> 02:40:26,534
you'll never get out of prison.

2185
02:40:26,618 --> 02:40:29,370
You lie about one dollar,
in one offshore account,

2186
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:31,748
you'll never get out of prison.

2187
02:40:32,832 --> 02:40:37,086
Now you can live life rich in jail
for the rest of your born days,

2188
02:40:37,587 --> 02:40:40,215
or be poor outside
for some of them.

2189
02:40:41,132 --> 02:40:43,468
That's what I can promise you.

2190
02:40:46,304 --> 02:40:52,477
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want, I want them cops

2191
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:57,023
that took that money
out of my pockets.

2192
02:40:59,734 --> 02:41:01,319
Him, too.

2193
02:41:01,402 --> 02:41:03,321
All right. Okay.

2194
02:41:05,156 --> 02:41:07,450
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.

2195
02:41:08,076 --> 02:41:10,662
So these guys are all connected up
to Gwynn, all right.

2196
02:41:10,787 --> 02:41:13,414
See this guy here,
he's in uniform...

2197
02:41:14,249 --> 02:41:16,543
Four police
officers were arrested today

2198
02:41:16,626 --> 02:41:19,170
on charges of taking bribes
from drug traffickers.

2199
02:41:19,295 --> 02:41:20,505
Well done, Jimmy.

2200
02:41:20,588 --> 02:41:22,715
The investigation
into police corruption

2201
02:41:22,799 --> 02:41:25,969
has swept through New York's
drug enforcement ranks

2202
02:41:26,094 --> 02:41:29,514
broadened today with
the arrest of 19 more officers.

2203
02:41:30,515 --> 02:41:34,227
In what is being called this
city's largest police corruption scandal,

2204
02:41:34,310 --> 02:41:38,523
32 more officers were indicted today
in federal court on bribery charges.

2205
02:41:38,648 --> 02:41:41,818
These police officers
will face stiff prison terms,

2206
02:41:41,943 --> 02:41:44,821
say federal prosecutors,
if found guilty.

2207
02:41:44,946 --> 02:41:47,426
A report by
federal investigators into New York's

2208
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:49,617
ever widening police
corruption scandal

2209
02:41:49,701 --> 02:41:52,370
claims that more than
half of the city's officers

2210
02:41:52,495 --> 02:41:56,708
assigned to drug enforcement have
engaged in some form of corruption.

2211
02:41:57,667 --> 02:42:00,962
Allegations
of widespread corruption within

2212
02:42:01,045 --> 02:42:03,548
the elite narcotics squad SIU

2213
02:42:03,673 --> 02:42:07,176
have led to the arrest of
more New York City detectives.

2214
02:42:07,385 --> 02:42:08,678
Convicted of extortion,

2215
02:42:08,803 --> 02:42:12,056
members of New York City's
Special Investigations Narcotics Unit

2216
02:42:12,181 --> 02:42:15,226
will face sentencing
today in federal court.

2217
02:42:17,145 --> 02:42:20,064
MacNamara. Vendazzo.

2218
02:42:21,232 --> 02:42:22,567
Trupo.

2219
02:42:25,862 --> 02:42:27,322
You are special.

2220
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,700
It's good work, Frank.

2221
02:43:13,868 --> 02:43:15,244
You know...

2222
02:43:15,411 --> 02:43:19,082
You don't want a drink or something?
Celebrate?

2223
02:43:19,666 --> 02:43:21,584
You got any holy water?

2224
02:44:16,139 --> 02:44:18,933
Check your property. Sign, please.

2225
02:45:10,818 --> 02:45:14,280
Smell better out here?

2226
02:45:32,632 --> 02:45:35,134
Frank. There you are.

2227
02:45:35,885 --> 02:45:38,429
Caffe latte. Yeah.
Latte?

2228
02:45:38,513 --> 02:45:41,390
Oh, shit. Yeah.
You all right?

2229
02:45:41,557 --> 02:45:44,477
That's a fancy way of saying
coffee with milk.

2230
02:45:44,644 --> 02:45:45,978
Yeah.
$2.50.

2231
02:45:49,482 --> 02:45:51,943
So you been talking
to your brothers?

2232
02:45:52,026 --> 02:45:55,404
No, no, I ain't talked to them in years.
It's probably best for them.

2233
02:45:59,367 --> 02:46:03,829
What the hell am I going to do out here,
Richie? I don't know how I'm gonna live.

2234
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:09,126
Hey, I told ya, I ain't gonna
let you starve, all right?

2235
02:46:09,210 --> 02:46:10,670
Obviously, you ain't starving.

2236
02:46:11,921 --> 02:46:15,007
Bagels and blinches. They will
catch up with you, you know?

2237
02:46:19,178 --> 02:46:20,263
Who's this?

2238
02:46:20,888 --> 02:46:23,683
Expensive sneakers.
About $100 a pair.

2239
02:46:33,025 --> 02:46:34,944
Frederick Douglass Boulevard.

2240
02:46:36,237 --> 02:46:41,200
This used to be Eighth Avenue, why do they
call it Frederick Douglass Boulevard now?

2241
02:46:45,454 --> 02:46:48,541
This was me Richie, right here.
This was all me.

2242
02:46:50,042 --> 02:46:52,169
In my day there were so many niggers
out here buying dope

2243
02:46:52,253 --> 02:46:54,964
you could've made a Tarzan movie.

2244
02:46:55,715 --> 02:46:59,218
You know, one phone call, I'll be right
back in business, you know that.

2245
02:46:59,302 --> 02:47:02,722
You don't do that, Frank.
These days I keep all my promises.

2246
02:47:13,899 --> 02:47:16,235
Why'd you come and get me, huh?

2247
02:47:16,319 --> 02:47:18,279
You're a superstar, Frank.

2248
02:47:18,404 --> 02:47:19,614
A superstar?

2249
02:47:20,781 --> 02:47:24,910
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.

2250
02:47:25,328 --> 02:47:28,414
Thought the least we could do
is give you a ride home.

2251
02:47:28,748 --> 02:47:32,668
Yeah, you sure did that.
You gave me a ride home. Free ride.

2252
02:47:33,127 --> 02:47:35,588
Coming to gangsters.

2253
02:47:39,300 --> 02:47:40,426
What?

2254
02:47:42,762 --> 02:47:45,765
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.

2255
02:47:46,515 --> 02:47:48,684
That's life right there.
That's life right there.

2256
02:47:49,101 --> 02:47:52,355
Even a fool gets to
be young once.
